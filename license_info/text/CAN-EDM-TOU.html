  <h1>Open Data Terms of Use</h1>

  <p>These Terms of Use are intended to protect and promote the City of Edmonton's
  commitments to open data and ensure that the recipients of these datasets give back to
  the community the benefits they derive from these datasets. If you have any questions
  or comments about these Terms of Use, please feel free to contact us at <a href=
  "mailto:opendata@edmonton.ca">opendata@edmonton.ca</a>.</p>

  <h2>Authority</h2>

  <p>You agree to these Terms of Use by either: (1) clicking to accept the Terms of Use;
  or (2) downloading or using any of the datasets. You represent that you have full
  capacity and authority to accept these Terms of Use. If you are accepting on behalf of
  your employer or another entity, you represent that you have full authority to bind
  your employer or such other entity to the Terms of Use.</p>

  <h2>Your Open Licence to the Datasets</h2>

  <p>The City of Edmonton (the City) now grants you a worldwide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive licence to use, modify, and distribute the datasets in all current and
  future media and formats for any lawful purpose. You now acknowledge that this licence
  does not give you a copyright or other proprietary interest in the datasets. If you
  distribute or provide access to these datasets to any other person, whether in original
  or modified form, you agree to include a copy of, or this Uniform Resource Locator
  (URL) for, these Terms of Use and to ensure any such person agrees to, and is bound by,
  them but without introducing any further restrictions of any kind.</p>

  <h2>Giving City Credit</h2>

  <p>Although you are not required to credit the City for each use or reproduction of the
  datasets, you are entitled to do so and encouraged to conspicuously announce that these
  datasets are publicly available from the City under these Terms of Use. Upon the
  request of the City, you may be required to remove a credit from future uses or
  reproductions should the City, in its sole discretion, decide that such credit is not
  in the public interest.</p>

  <h2>Future Changes to Datasets/Terms of Use</h2>

  <p>The City may at any time and from time to time add, delete, or change the datasets
  or these Terms of Use. Notice of changes may be posted on the home page for these
  datasets or this page. Any change is effective immediately upon posting, unless
  otherwise stated.</p>

  <h2>Compliance with Law Your Responsibility</h2>

  <p>You assume sole responsibility for your use and reproduction of the datasets and for
  complying with all applicable laws and industry standards.</p>

  <h2>No Warranty with Datasets</h2>

  <p>You get NO WARRANTIES, none of any kind, in respect to the datasets or your use of
  them. For example (but without limiting the total intended scope of the preceding
  sentence):</p>

  <ol>
    <li>while reasonable efforts have been made in preparing these datasets for use by
    you, the City does not give any promises as to the completeness, currency or accuracy
    of the datasets or that access will be continuous;</li>

    <li>the City does not make any promise that the datasets are free and clear of any
    possible third party copyright, moral rights, other proprietary right or other
    claim;</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please note that the datasets have been modified from their original source, as data
  initially generated by the City for its internal uses and that all data visualizations
  on maps are approximate and include only records that can be mapped. You accept these
  datasets on an "as is, where is" basis and agree to use them solely at your own
  risk.</p>

  <h2>Exclusion of Liability</h2>

  <p>You agree that you will not and cannot sue the City for anything which the City does
  or does not do (even if intentional or negligent) in connection with the datasets and
  your use or inability to use them. Without limiting the general scope of the preceding
  sentence, this means that the City and its officers, employees, representatives and
  agents are not liable on any legal theory or basis for any direct, incidental,
  indirect, special, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages or losses, including
  without limitation, loss of revenue or anticipated profits, loss of goodwill, loss of
  business, loss of data, computer failure or malfunction or any other damages or losses
  arising from your access to, and use of, the datasets.</p>

  <h2>Liability for Not Complying with Terms of Use</h2>

  <p>If, as a result of your breach of these Terms of Use, the City gets sued or is
  required to pay someone money, you agree to protect the City and reimburse the City for
  everything which you cause the City to suffer. This means that you agree to defend,
  indemnify and hold harmless the City and all of its officers, employees,
  representatives and agents from any and all liabilities incurred in connection with any
  claim arising from any breach by you of these Terms of Use, including reasonable legal
  fees and costs. You agree to cooperate fully in the defence of any such claim. The City
  reserves the right to assume, at its own expense, the exclusive defence and control of
  any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. You agree not to settle any
  matter without the written consent of the City.</p>

  <h2>Cancellation for Non-Compliance</h2>

  <p>The City may, in its sole discretion, cancel or suspend your access to the datasets
  without notice and for any reason, including anything which the City, in its sole
  discretion, believes is a breach of these Terms of Use or is otherwise unlawful or
  harmful to others. In the event of cancellation or suspension, you will no longer be
  authorized to use or reproduce these datasets, and the City may use any means possible
  to enforce its decision. Such cancellation or suspension will not affect any person who
  has received the datasets from you and who is otherwise in compliance with these Terms
  of Use.</p>

  <h2>No Endorsement</h2>

  <p>You may not publicly represent or imply that the City is participating in, or has
  sponsored, approved or endorsed the manner or purpose of your use or reproduction of
  the datasets.</p>

  <h2>No Association</h2>

  <p>You may not use any trade-mark, official mark, official emblem or logo of the City,
  or any of its other means of promotion or publicity, without the City's prior written
  consent nor in any event to represent or imply an association or affiliation with the
  City.</p>

  <h2>No Waiver</h2>

  <p>You agree that, if the City does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
  contained in these Terms of Use (or that the City has the benefit of under any
  applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of the City's rights and
  that those rights or remedies will still be available to the City. Any waiver of any
  provision of these Terms of Use will be effective only if the City expressly states in
  a signed writing that it is waiving a specified provision.</p>

  <h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>

  <p>These datasets are published from within the Province of Alberta, Canada. These
  Terms of Use are governed by Alberta law and the City and you now irrevocably submit to
  the exclusive jurisdiction of Alberta courts with respect to any and all matters
  arising under these Terms of Use or access to, or use of, these datasets.</p>
