<h3>About the Open Government License for BC Government Information</h3>
<p>The Province of British Columbia wishes to use this license as a tool to enable the use and re-use of Information under a common open license. This license is based upon the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/">UK Government’s Open Government Licence for Public Sector Information</a> and has been adapted with the permission of the UK National Archives.</p>
<p>This is version 1.0 of the Open Government License for Government of BC Information. The Province of British Columbia may, from time to time, issue new versions of the Open Government License for Government of BC Information. However, you may continue to use Information licensed under this version should you wish to do so. Notices of new versions of the Open Government License for Government of BC Information will be posted at the <a href="http://data.gov.bc.ca">DataBC</a> website.</p>
<p>The Open Government License for BC Government Information is being launched in beta form because it is recognized that it can be developed and improved through further feedback from the public and other stakeholders, and the approach should be open to further testing after launch.</p>
