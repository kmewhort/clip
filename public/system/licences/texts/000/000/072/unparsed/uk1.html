<h3> About the Open Government Licence</h3>

<p>The Controller of Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) has developed this licence as a tool to enable Information

    Controller invites public sector bodies owning their own copyright and database rights to permit the use of their
    Information under this licence.</p>

<p>The Controller of HMSO has authority to license Information subject to copyright and database right owned by the
    Crown. The extent of the Controller’s offer to license this Information under the terms of this licence is set out
    in the <a href="/information-management/government-licensing/the-framework.htm" target="_blank">UK Government
        Licensing Framework</a>. </p>

<p>This is version 1.0 of the Open Government Licence. The Controller of HMSO may, from time to time, issue new versions
    of the Open Government Licence. However, you may continue to use Information licensed under this version should you
    wish to do so.</p>

    copyright, and Open Data Commons Attribution License, which covers database rights and applicable copyrights.</p>
