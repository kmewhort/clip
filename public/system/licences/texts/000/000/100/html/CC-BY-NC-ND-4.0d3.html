					<p><strong><em>Using this Public License</em></strong></p>
					<p>
This Public License provides a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other content and materials subject to Copyright and Similar Rights (defined below).
					</p>
					<p>
<strong>Considerations for licensors:</strong> This irrevocable Public License is intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by Copyright and Similar Rights.  Licensors should read and understand its terms and conditions before using it.  Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying this Public License to material, to enable its reuse by the public as intended.  Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to this Public License, such as other CC-licensed material they have used or material used under an exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights.  More considerations for licensors [hyper-link]
					</p>
					<p>
<strong>Considerations for the public:</strong> By applying this Public License, a licensor grants the public permission to use the material licensed on specified terms and conditions when permission is required because of the licensor&rsquo;s Copyright and Similar Rights.  If the licensor&rsquo;s permission is not necessary for any reason, including because of any applicable exceptions and limitations to Copyright and Similar Rights, then that use is not regulated by this Public License.  This Public License only licenses Copyright and Similar Rights that a licensor has authority to license.  Use of the material licensed here could be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material.  More considerations for the public [hyper-link]

				<p>
By exercising the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here, You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Public License.  To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the rights below in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available to the public under these terms and conditions.

<li id="s1a">
<strong>Adapted Material</strong> means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here.  For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance or sound recording, Adapted Material is produced when the Licensed Material is synched in timed-relation with a moving image.  In addition, if the Licensor has Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to You, if You extract all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database and include that content in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its contents) is Adapted Material.

					<li id="s1b">
<strong>Copyright and Similar Rights</strong> means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, phonogram and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.
