software--to make sure</ins> the <del class="diffmod">City's</del><ins class="diffmod">software</ins> <del class="diffmod">commitments</del><ins class="diffmod">is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies</ins> to <del class="diffmod">open</del><ins class="diffmod">most</ins> <del class="diffmod">data</del><ins class="diffmod">of the Free Software
Foundation's software</ins> and <del class="diffmod">ensure</del><ins class="diffmod">to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure</ins> that<ins class="diffins"> you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give</ins> the recipients<ins class="diffins"> all the rights that</ins>
<del class="diffmod">of</del><ins class="diffmod">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them</ins> these <del class="diffmod">data</del><ins class="diffmod">terms</ins> <del class="diffmod">sets</del><ins class="diffmod">so</ins> <del class="diffmod">give</del><ins class="diffmod">they</ins> <del class="diffmod">back</del><ins class="diffmod">know their
rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
