          designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor

          ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,

          supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
          URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated
          with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
          copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
          The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be
          implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
          that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such
          credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
          authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these
          credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
          credits for the other contributing authors. For the
          avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
          by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
          manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
          this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
          or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
          by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
          Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
