</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on
the Runtime Library.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">"GCC"</ins> means <ins class="diffins">a version of </ins>the <del class="diffmod">individual</del><ins class="diffmod">GNU Compiler Collection, with or
without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later
version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of
using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of
propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in
accord with the license of GCC.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or
virtual target processor architecture, in executable form</ins> or <del class="diffmod">entity</del><ins class="diffmod">suitable
for</ins> <ins class="diffins">input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase.
Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format
</ins>that <del class="diffmod">offers</del><ins class="diffmod">is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for
producing a compiler intermediate representation.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code.  Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of</ins> the <del class="diffmod">Work</del><ins class="diffmod">Compilation</ins> <del class="diffmod">under</del><ins class="diffmod">Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone
or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using
any work based on GCC.  For example, using non-GPL-compatible
Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not
qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
