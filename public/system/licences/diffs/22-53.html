  The purpose</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Use</del></h1><del class="diffmod">

    </del><ins class="diffmod">this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
  functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
  assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
  with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
  Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
  to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
  for modifications made by others.

    If</del><ins class="diffmod">

  This</ins> <del class="diffmod">you</del><ins class="diffmod">License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
  license designed for free software.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  We have designed this License in order to</ins> use <ins class="diffins">it for manuals for free
  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
  software does.  But </ins>this <del class="diffmod">website,</del><ins class="diffmod">License is not limited to software manuals;
  it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
  whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
  principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

  </ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
  distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
  world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
  work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
  refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
  licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if</ins> you<ins class="diffins">
  copy,</ins> <del class="diffmod">agree</del><ins class="diffmod">modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
  under copyright law.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
  Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
  modifications and/or translated into another language.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
  the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
  publishers or authors of the Document</ins> to the <del class="diffmod">following</del><ins class="diffmod">Document's</ins> <del class="diffmod">Terms</del><ins class="diffmod">overall subject
  (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
  within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
  textbook</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Use</del><ins class="diffmod">mathematics,</ins> <ins class="diffins">a Secondary Section may not explain any
  mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
  connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
  commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
  them.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
  are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
  that says that the Document is released under this License.  </ins>If <del class="diffmod">you</del><ins class="diffmod">a
  section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
  allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
  Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
  Sections then there are none.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
  as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
  the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
  be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the
  general public, that is suitable for revising the document
  straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
  pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
  drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
  for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
  to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
  format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
  or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
  An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
  of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
  ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
  or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
  HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
  transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
  include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
  proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
  processing tools are not generally available, and the
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
  processors for output purposes only.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
  plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
  this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
  formats which</ins> do not <del class="diffmod">agree
    with</del><ins class="diffmod">have</ins> <del class="diffmod">these</del><ins class="diffmod">any</ins> <del class="diffmod">Terms</del><ins class="diffmod">title page as such, "Title Page" means
  the text near the most prominent appearance</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Use,</del><ins class="diffmod">the work's title,
  preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
  title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
  text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
  specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
  "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
  of such a section when</ins> you <del class="diffmod">must</del><ins class="diffmod">modify</ins> <del class="diffmod">leave</del><ins class="diffmod">the Document means that it remains a
  section "Entitled XYZ" according to</ins> this <del class="diffmod">website</del><ins class="diffmod">definition.
