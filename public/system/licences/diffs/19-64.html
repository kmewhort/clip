</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share</ins> and <ins class="diffins">change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if </ins>you <del class="diffmod">(either an individual or a legal entity</del><ins class="diffmod">wish),</ins> that you <del class="diffmod">represent</del><ins class="diffmod">receive</ins> <del class="diffmod">as</del><ins class="diffmod">source</ins> <del class="diffmod">an authorized employee</del><ins class="diffmod">code</ins> or <del class="diffmod">agent).</del><br><br><strong><del class="diffmod">Acceptance</del><ins class="diffmod">can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Terms</del></strong><ins class="diffmod">it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</ins>
<ins class="diffins">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><del class="diffmod">Please</del><ins class="diffmod">
  For</ins> <del class="diffmod">review</del><ins class="diffmod">example,</ins> <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">if</ins> <del class="diffmod">Agreement</del><ins class="diffmod">you</ins> <del class="diffmod">carefully.</del><ins class="diffmod">distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.</ins>  If you <del class="diffmod">access,</del><ins class="diffmod">link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free</ins> use or <del class="diffmod">download</del><ins class="diffmod">not</ins> <del class="diffmod">any</del><ins class="diffmod">licensed at all.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative</ins> of the <del class="diffmod">datasets</del><ins class="diffmod">original</ins> <del class="diffmod">(collectively,</del><ins class="diffmod">library, and</ins> the <del class="diffmod">&ldquo;Data&rdquo;)</del><ins class="diffmod">ordinary</ins> <del class="diffmod">provided</del><ins class="diffmod">General</ins> <del class="diffmod">by</del><ins class="diffmod">Public</ins> <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">License
treats</ins> <del class="diffmod">City</del><ins class="diffmod">it</ins> <del class="diffmod">on</del><ins class="diffmod">as</ins> <del class="diffmod">this website you acknowledge that you have read, understood, agree and have the capacity to be legally bound by the terms</del><ins class="diffmod">such.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Because</ins> of this <del class="diffmod">Agreement.  If</del><ins class="diffmod">blurred</ins> <del class="diffmod">you</del><ins class="diffmod">distinction,</ins> <del class="diffmod">do</del><ins class="diffmod">using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did</ins> not <del class="diffmod">agree</del><ins class="diffmod">effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

     If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.
     </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">3.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
 You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">4.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
 You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">5.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
 A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the</ins> use of the <del class="diffmod">Data</del><ins class="diffmod">object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library</ins> will <del class="diffmod">be</del><ins class="diffmod">still</ins> <del class="diffmod">governed</del><ins class="diffmod">fall</ins> <del class="diffmod">by</del><ins class="diffmod">under Section 6.)
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under</ins> the terms of <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">Section</ins> <del class="diffmod">Agreement</del><ins class="diffmod">6.

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
