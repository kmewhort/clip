  The</ins> <del class="diffmod">PREAMBLE</del></strong><ins class="diffmod">licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

</del>freedom to <del class="diffmod">copy</del><ins class="diffmod">distribute</ins> <del class="diffmod">and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
considered responsible for modifications made by others.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">This License is a kind</del><ins class="diffmod">copies</ins> of<del class="diffdel"> "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
software.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because</del> free software <del class="diffmod">needs</del><ins class="diffmod">(and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new</ins> free <del class="diffmod">documentation:</del><ins class="diffmod">programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, if you distribute copies of such</ins> a<ins class="diffins"> program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><a id="section1"></a><p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">1.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins">
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and

      You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
      parties under the terms of this License.

      If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    </ins></dd><ins class="diffins">
</ins></dl><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and </ins>can<ins class="diffins"> be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A "Transparent"</del><ins class="diffmod">complete
      machine-readable</ins> copy of the <del class="diffmod">Document</del><ins class="diffmod">corresponding</ins> <del class="diffmod">means</del><ins class="diffmod">source</ins> <del class="diffmod">a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available</del><ins class="diffmod">code,</ins> to <del class="diffdel">the general public,
whose contents can </del>be<del class="diffmod"> viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">2. VERBATIM COPYING</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">4. MODIFICATIONS</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:</del></p><del class="diffmod">
</del><ul><del class="diffmod">
</del><li><del class="diffmod">
</del><strong><del class="diffmod">A.</del></strong><del class="diffmod"> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a

    of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
    original publisher of that version gives permission.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

    is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the
    title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title
    Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
    previous sentence.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

    a network location for a work that was published at least four years before
    the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers

 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
