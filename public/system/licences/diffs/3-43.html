          take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
          which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
          or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
          jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
          right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
          to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
          mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
          prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
          reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
          appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
          permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
          to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
          this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
          otherwise.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">
