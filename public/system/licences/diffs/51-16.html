          of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
          License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
          on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
          the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
          rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
          License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
          intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
          disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
          effective technological measures on the Work that
          restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
          to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
          the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
          the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
          not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
          be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
          create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
          must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
          Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
          requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
          any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
          from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
          4(b), as requested.</del></li><del class="diffdel">

          intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
          reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
          the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
          applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
          and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,

          attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
          copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
          means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
          of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
          practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
          be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
          refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
          for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in
          the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
          of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
          of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
          original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
          by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any
          reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
          a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
          appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
          Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
          credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
          credits for the other contributing authors. For the
          avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
          by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
          manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
          this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
          or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
          by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
          Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,

          which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor

          jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
          right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
          to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
          mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
          prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
          reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
          appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
          permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
          to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
