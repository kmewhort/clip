  (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly

  them.

  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,

  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
  ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML

  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
  plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
  this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
  formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
  the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
  preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
  title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
  text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
  specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
  "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
  of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
  section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
  commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
  copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
  to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
  conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
  technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
  copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
  compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
  number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
  you may publicly display copies.

  </ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
  printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
  Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
  copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
  Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
  the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
  you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
  the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
  visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
  the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
  as verbatim copying in other respects.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
  legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
  reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
  pages.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
  more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
  copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
  a computer-network location from which the general network-using
  public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
  a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
  when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
  that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
  location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
  Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
  edition to the public.

  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
