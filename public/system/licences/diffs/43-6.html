          under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
          of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
          License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
          on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
          the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
          rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
          License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
          intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
          disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
          effective technological measures on the Work that
          restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
          to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
          the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
          the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
          not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
          be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
          create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
          must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
          Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as
          requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
          any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
          from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
          4(d), as requested.</del></li><del class="diffdel">

          License"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for
          Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
          impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the

          recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
          granted to that recipient under the terms of the

          Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of
          the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to
          that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
          This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
          incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
          the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be
          made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.</del></li><del class="diffdel">

          for other copyrighted works by means of digital
          file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
          intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or

          intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
          reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)

          and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
          a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
          attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
          copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
          means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
          of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
          practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
          be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
          refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
          for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in
          the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
          of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
          of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
          original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
          by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable
          manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
          Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
          appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
          Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
          credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
          credits for the other contributing authors. For the
          avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
          by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
          manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
          this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
          or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
          by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
