</del><p><del class="diffmod">You</del><ins class="diffmod">licenses for most software and other practical works</ins> are <del class="diffmod">encouraged</del><ins class="diffmod">designed
to take away your freedom</ins> to <del class="diffmod">use</del><ins class="diffmod">share</ins> and <del class="diffmod">re-use</del><ins class="diffmod">change</ins> the <del class="diffmod">Information</del><ins class="diffmod">works.  By</ins> <del class="diffmod">that</del><ins class="diffmod">contrast,
the GNU General Public License</ins> is <del class="diffmod">available</del><ins class="diffmod">intended</ins> <del class="diffmod">under</del><ins class="diffmod">to</ins> <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">guarantee</ins> <del class="diffmod">license,</del><ins class="diffmod">your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We,</ins> the <del class="diffmod">Open</del><ins class="diffmod">Free</ins> <del class="diffmod">Government</del><ins class="diffmod">Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public</ins> License for <del class="diffmod">Government</del><ins class="diffmod">most</ins> of <del class="diffmod">BC</del><ins class="diffmod">our</ins> <del class="diffmod">Information,</del><ins class="diffmod">software;</ins> <del class="diffmod">freely</del><ins class="diffmod">it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs,</ins> and <del class="diffmod">flexibly,</del><ins class="diffmod">that you know you can do these things.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights</ins> with <del class="diffmod">only</del><ins class="diffmod">two</ins> <del class="diffmod">a</del><ins class="diffmod">steps:
(1)</ins> <del class="diffmod">few</del><ins class="diffmod">assert</ins> <del class="diffmod">conditions.</del></p><del class="diffmod">
</del><p class="title"><del class="diffmod">Using</del><ins class="diffmod">copyright</ins> <del class="diffmod">Information</del><ins class="diffmod">on</ins> <del class="diffmod">under</del><ins class="diffmod">the software, and (2) offer you</ins> this <del class="diffmod">license</del><ins class="diffmod">License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains</ins>
<ol class="license"><ins class="diffmod">that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and</ins>
<li><ins class="diffmod">authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</ins>
<div class="text"><del class="diffmod">Your</del><ins class="diffmod">changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and</ins> use of<ins class="diffins">
software</ins> <del class="diffmod">any</del><ins class="diffmod">on</ins> <del class="diffmod">Information</del><ins class="diffmod">general-purpose</ins> <del class="diffmod">indicates</del><ins class="diffmod">computers,</ins> <del class="diffmod">your</del><ins class="diffmod">but</ins> <del class="diffmod">acceptance</del><ins class="diffmod">in</ins> <del class="diffmod">of</del><ins class="diffmod">those that do, we wish to
avoid</ins> the<ins class="diffins"> special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  </ins>The <del class="diffmod">Information</del><ins class="diffmod">resulting</ins> <del class="diffmod">Provider</del><ins class="diffmod">work</ins> <del class="diffmod">hereby</del><ins class="diffmod">is</ins> <del class="diffmod">grants</del><ins class="diffmod">called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make</ins> you <ins class="diffins">directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying </ins>a <del class="diffmod">worldwide,</del><ins class="diffmod">private</ins> <del class="diffmod">royalty-free,</del><ins class="diffmod">copy.

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

for making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source
form of a work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of

is widely used among developers working in that language.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a

available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
