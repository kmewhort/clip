accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing </ins>any<ins class="diffins"> large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one
