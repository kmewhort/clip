document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves</ins> for <del class="diffmod">formal</del><ins class="diffmod">the

considered responsible for modifications made by others.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
the document must themselves be free in</ins> the <del class="diffmod">meantime,</del><ins class="diffmod">same</ins> <del class="diffmod">please</del><ins class="diffmod">sense.</ins> <del class="diffmod">treat</del><ins class="diffmod">It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
software.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">We have designed</ins> this<ins class="diffins"> License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published</ins> as a <del class="diffmod">broad</del><ins class="diffmod">printed
book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of
this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any
member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">2. VERBATIM COPYING</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's</ins> license<ins class="diffins"> notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">4. MODIFICATIONS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><ul><ins class="diffins">
</ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">A.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a
    title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
    versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
    of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
    original publisher of that version gives permission.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">B.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more
    persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
    Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of
    the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">C.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of
    the Modified Version, as the publisher.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

    a network location for a work that was published at least four years before

</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">L.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod"> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,

</ins></ul><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
other section titles.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization
as the authoritative definition of a standard.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a

Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of
Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one
entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
acting</ins> on <ins class="diffins">behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace </ins>the <del class="diffmod">City</del><ins class="diffmod">old one,

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may combine</ins> the <del class="diffmod">accuracy</del><ins class="diffmod">Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all</ins> of <del class="diffmod">information</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">against</del><ins class="diffmod">Invariant Sections of
all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else
a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the
various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents

compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their
being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some</ins> or <del class="diffmod">delivered</del><ins class="diffmod">all Invariant Sections in
addition</ins> to the <del class="diffmod">City</del><ins class="diffmod">original versions</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Nanaimo,</del><ins class="diffmod">these Invariant Sections. You may include
