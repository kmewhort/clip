  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Use</del></h2><ins class="diffmod">the Free Software</ins>
<ins class="diffins">Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><span style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 12px;"><del class="diffmod">By</del><ins class="diffmod">
  When</ins> <del class="diffmod">using</del><ins class="diffmod">we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you</ins> this <del class="diffmod">website</del><ins class="diffmod">license which gives</ins> you <del class="diffmod">are</del><ins class="diffmod">legal</ins> <del class="diffmod">agreeing</del><ins class="diffmod">permission</ins> to <del class="diffmod">comply</del><ins class="diffmod">copy,
distribute</ins> <del class="diffmod">with</del><ins class="diffmod">and/or modify the software.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

  Also, for each author's protection</ins> and <ins class="diffins">ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must </ins>be <del class="diffmod">bound</del><ins class="diffmod">licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on</ins> the <del class="diffmod">following</del><ins class="diffmod">Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

      </ins>If <ins class="diffins">the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, </ins>you<ins class="diffins"> must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    </ins></dd><ins class="diffins">
</ins></dl><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms,</ins> do not <del class="diffmod">agree</del><ins class="diffmod">apply</ins> to <del class="diffmod">these</del><ins class="diffmod">those
sections</ins> <del class="diffmod">terms,</del><ins class="diffmod">when</ins> you <del class="diffmod">should</del><ins class="diffmod">distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
