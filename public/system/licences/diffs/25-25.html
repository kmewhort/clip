<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>By accessing the data sets, you agree to these Terms of Use, which are intended to
protect and promote the City's commitments to open data and ensure that the recipients
of these data sets give back to the community the benefits they derive from these data
sets.<br>If you have any questions or comments about these Terms of Use, please feel free to
contact us.</p>

<h2>Your open licence to the data sets</h2>
<p>The City of Windsor (City) now grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
licence to use, modify, and distribute the data sets in all current and future media and
formats for any lawful purpose. You now acknowledge that this licence does not give
you a copyright or other proprietary interest in the data sets. If you distribute or provide
access to these data sets to any other person, whether in original or modified form, you
agree to include a copy of, or this Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for, these Terms of
Use and to ensure they agree to and are bound by them but without introducing any
further restrictions of any kind.</p>

<h2>Giving City credit</h2>
<p>Although you are not required to credit the City for each use or reproduction of the data
sets, you are entitled to do so and encouraged to conspicuously announce that these
data sets are publicly available from the City under these Terms of Use. Upon the
request of the City, you may be required to remove a credit from future uses or
reproductions should the City decide that such credit is not in the public interest.</p>

<h2>Future changes to data sets/Terms of Use</h2>
<p>The City may at any time and from time to time add, delete, or change the data sets or
these Terms of Use. Notice of changes may be posted on the home page for these data
sets or this page. Any change is effective immediately upon posting, unless otherwise
stated.</p>

<h2>Compliance with law - Your responsibility</h2>
<p>You assume sole responsibility for your use and reproduction of the data sets and for
complying with all applicable laws and industry standards.</p>

<h2>No warranty with data sets</h2>
<p>You get NO WARRANTIES, none of any kind. By this, we mean, for example (but
without limiting the total intended scope of the preceding sentence), (1) that while
reasonable efforts have been made in preparing these data sets for use by you, the City
cannot give any promises as to the completeness, currency, or accuracy of the data
sets nor that access will be continuous; (2) the City cannot make any promise that the
data sets are free and clear of any possible third party copyright, moral rights, or other
claim; (3) the data sets have been modified from their original source, as data initially
generated by the City for its internal uses; and (4) all data visualizations on maps are
approximate and include only records that can be mapped.<br><br>
You accept these data sets on an "as-is, where is" basis and agree to use them at your
own risk.</p>

<h2>Exclusion of liability</h2>
<p>You agree that you will not and cannot sue the City for anything, which the City does or
does not do (even if intentional or negligent) in connection with the data sets and your
use or inability to use them. Without limiting the general scope of the preceding
sentence, this means that the City and its agents are not liable on any legal theory or
basis for any direct, incidental, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, or consequential
damages or losses, including without limitation, loss of revenue or anticipated profits,
loss of goodwill, loss of business, loss of data, computer failure or malfunction, or any
other damages or losses.</p>

<h2>Liability for not complying with Terms of Use</h2>
<p>If, as a result of your breach of these Terms of Use, the City gets sued or is required to
pay someone money, you agree to protect the City and reimburse the City for
everything which you cause the City to suffer. This means that you agree to defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless the City and all of its agents from any and all liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim arising from any breach by you of these Terms of
Use, including reasonable legal fees and costs. You agree to cooperate fully in the
defence of any such claim. The City reserves the right to assume, at its own expense,
the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by
you. You agree not to settle any matter without the written consent of the City.</p>

<h2>Cancellation for non-compliance</h2>
<p>The City may, in its sole discretion, cancel or suspend your access to the data sets
without notice and for any reason, including anything which the City, in its sole
discretion, believes is a breach of these Terms of Use or is otherwise unlawful or
harmful to others. In the event of cancellation or suspension, you will no longer be
authorized to use or reproduce these data sets, and the City may use any means
possible to enforce its decision. Such cancellation or suspension will not affect any
person who has received the data sets from you and who is otherwise in compliance
with these Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>No endorsement</h2>
<p>You may not publicly represent or imply that the City is participating in, or has
sponsored, approved, or endorsed the manner or purpose of, your use or reproduction
of these data sets.</p>

<h2>No association</h2>
<p>You may not use any trademark, official mark, official emblem or logo, of the City, or
any of its other references or means of promotion or publicity without the City&rsquo;s prior
written consent nor in any event to represent or imply an association or affiliation with
the City.</p>

<h2>Governing law and jurisdiction from which data sets are published</h2>
<p>These data sets are published from within the province of Ontario, Canada. These
Terms of Use are governed by Ontario law and the City and you now irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of Ontario courts with respect to any and all matters arising
under these Terms of Use or these data sets.</p>
