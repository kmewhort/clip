    </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

    </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

    </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">b. A license of the Database Right; and</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

    </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

    </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the Database,
    including:</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

    </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright
    licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the
    copyright over the Contents independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for
    details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the
    Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of
    the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data
    entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the Database;</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

    </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
    Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database Rights
    can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also
    apply when the Contents are removed from the Database and are selected and arranged
    in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright; and</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

    </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to the

    patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not
    cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents
    contained in the Database. For example, if used on a Database of images (the
    Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which
    could have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the
    rights over the images.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

    of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may
    be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

    </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The rights granted cover, for example:</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
