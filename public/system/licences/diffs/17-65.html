</ins><h3><a id="SEC2"><ins class="diffmod">Preamble</ins></a></h3><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
</ins></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 12px;"><del class="diffmod">By</del><ins class="diffmod">
  This</ins> <del class="diffmod">using</del><ins class="diffmod">license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for</ins> this <del class="diffmod">website</del><ins class="diffmod">service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that</ins> you are <del class="diffmod">agreeing</del><ins class="diffmod">informed that you can do
these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  To protect your rights, we need</ins> to <del class="diffmod">comply</del><ins class="diffmod">make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code</ins> with <ins class="diffins">the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library </ins>and<ins class="diffins"> recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not</ins> be <del class="diffmod">bound</del><ins class="diffmod">affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><h3><a id="SEC3"><ins class="diffmod">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</ins></a></h3><ins class="diffmod">


</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">0.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed</ins> by the <del class="diffmod">following</del><ins class="diffmod">copyright</ins> <del class="diffmod">Terms</del><ins class="diffmod">holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  A "library" means a collection</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Use.</del><ins class="diffmod">software</ins> <del class="diffmod">Please</del><ins class="diffmod">functions</ins> <del class="diffmod">review</del><ins class="diffmod">and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either</ins> the <del class="diffmod">following</del><ins class="diffmod">Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">1.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">2.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the</ins> terms <del class="diffmod">carefully.</del><ins class="diffmod">of</ins> <ins class="diffins">Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><ul><ins class="diffins">
</ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">a)</ins></strong><ins class="diffins">
       The modified work must itself be a software library.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">b)</ins></strong><ins class="diffins">

       You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">c)</ins></strong><ins class="diffins">
       You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">d)</ins></strong><ins class="diffins">
       </ins>If <ins class="diffins">a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then </ins>you<ins class="diffins"> must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
       its purpose remains meaningful.
       </ins><p><ins class="diffins">

       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
       root function must still compute square roots.)</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
</ins></ul><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
this License, and its terms,</ins> do not <del class="diffmod">agree</del><ins class="diffmod">apply</ins> to <del class="diffmod">these</del><ins class="diffmod">those</ins> <del class="diffmod">terms,</del><ins class="diffmod">sections when you

sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the

distribute the source code, even though third parties are not

therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the

Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library,</ins> you <ins class="diffins">may

modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
