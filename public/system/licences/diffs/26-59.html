</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You</del><ins class="diffmod">and other practical works</ins> are <del class="diffmod">encouraged</del><ins class="diffmod">designed
to take away your freedom</ins> to <del class="diffmod">use</del><ins class="diffmod">share</ins> and <del class="diffmod">re-use</del><ins class="diffmod">change</ins> the <del class="diffmod">Information</del><ins class="diffmod">works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure</ins> that <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">you
have</ins> <del class="diffmod">available</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">under</del><ins class="diffmod">freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you</ins> this <del class="diffmod">licence,</del><ins class="diffmod">License
giving</ins> <del class="diffmod">freely</del><ins class="diffmod">you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">For the developers'</ins> and <del class="diffmod">flexibly,</del><ins class="diffmod">authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible</ins> with <del class="diffmod">only</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">a</del><ins class="diffmod">aim</ins> <del class="diffmod">few</del><ins class="diffmod">of
protecting</ins> <del class="diffmod">conditions.</del><ins class="diffmod">users'</ins> </p><ins class="diffmod">freedom to change the software.  The systematic</ins>
<h2 style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;"><ins class="diffmod">pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</ins>
<br><del class="diffmod">Using</del><ins class="diffmod">use,</ins> <del class="diffmod">Information</del><ins class="diffmod">which</ins> <del class="diffmod">under</del><ins class="diffmod">is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed</ins> this <del class="diffmod">Licence</del></h2><ins class="diffmod">version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</ins>
<ol><ins class="diffmod">products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</ins>
<li><ins class="diffmod">stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</ins>
<div><del class="diffmod">Your</del><ins class="diffmod">of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.

avoid</ins> the<ins class="diffins"> special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  </ins>The <del class="diffmod">Information</del><ins class="diffmod">resulting</ins> <del class="diffmod">Provider</del><ins class="diffmod">work</ins> <del class="diffmod">grants</del><ins class="diffmod">is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the
earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make</ins> you <ins class="diffins">directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying </ins>a <del class="diffmod">worldwide,</del><ins class="diffmod">private</ins> <del class="diffmod">royalty-free,</del><ins class="diffmod">copy.

public, and in some countries other activities as well.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source
form of a work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available</ins> to the <del class="diffmod">conditions</del><ins class="diffmod">public</ins> <del class="diffmod">below.</del></div><ins class="diffmod">in source code form.  A
&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</ins></p>

</li><p><ins class="diffmod">The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all</ins>

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product </ins>has<ins class="diffins"> substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you

</ins><li><ins class="diffins">a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

</ins><li><ins class="diffins">c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

</ins><li><ins class="diffins">d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you add terms to a covered work</ins> in <ins class="diffins">accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
