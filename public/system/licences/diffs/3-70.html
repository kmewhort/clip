jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that
cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,
the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to
act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),
and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the
contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL
together</ins> with <ins class="diffins">another license for the contents, if the contents have a
single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the
contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should
describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual
record </ins>or<ins class="diffins"> in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,
trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights
over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may
have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing
activities not covered by this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">      a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">      b. A license of the Database Right; and</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">      c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

Database, including:</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">      a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.
  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the
  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents
  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright
  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database
  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation
  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table
  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of
  Contents stored in the Database;</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">      b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.
  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the
      Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents</ins> are<del class="diffdel">
permitted</del> <del class="diffmod">provided</del><ins class="diffmod">removed
  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way</ins> that<ins class="diffins"> would
  not infringe any applicable copyright; and</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for
  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of
  use on this access as outlined in this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">2.3 Rights not covered.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making
  or operation of the Database;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the
  Database; and</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

      Database.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of
the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,
including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality
rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database
Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.
For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this
License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could
have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of
the rights over the images.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but
only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of
any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly
include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To
the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the
future.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The rights granted cover, for example:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect

  granted under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced

views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced
