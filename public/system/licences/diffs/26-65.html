</ins><h3><a id="SEC2"><ins class="diffins">Preamble</ins></a></h3><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><del class="diffmod">You</del><ins class="diffmod">
  The licenses for most software</ins> are <del class="diffmod">encouraged</del><ins class="diffmod">designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide</ins> to use <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">it.  You
can</ins> <del class="diffmod">re-use</del><ins class="diffmod">use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or</ins> the <del class="diffmod">Information</del><ins class="diffmod">ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish);</ins> that <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">you</ins> <del class="diffmod">available</del><ins class="diffmod">receive</ins> <del class="diffmod">under</del><ins class="diffmod">source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you</ins> this <del class="diffmod">licence,</del><ins class="diffmod">license,</ins> <del class="diffmod">freely</del><ins class="diffmod">which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else</ins> and <del class="diffmod">flexibly,</del><ins class="diffmod">passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent</ins> with <del class="diffmod">only</del><ins class="diffmod">the full freedom of use specified in this license.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  When</ins> a <del class="diffmod">few</del><ins class="diffmod">program</ins> <del class="diffmod">conditions.</del><ins class="diffmod">is</ins> <ins class="diffins">linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
</ins></p>
<h2 style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;"><del class="diffmod">
</del><br><del class="diffmod">Using</del><p><ins class="diffmod">
  We</ins> <del class="diffmod">Information under</del><ins class="diffmod">call</ins> this <del class="diffmod">Licence</del></h2><ins class="diffmod">license the "Lesser" General Public License because it</ins>
<ol><ins class="diffmod">does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General</ins>
<li><ins class="diffmod">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</ins>
<div><del class="diffmod">Your</del><ins class="diffmod">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible</ins> use of <del class="diffmod">Information</del><ins class="diffmod">a</ins> <del class="diffmod">indicates</del><ins class="diffmod">certain</ins> <del class="diffmod">your</del><ins class="diffmod">library,</ins> <del class="diffmod">acceptance</del><ins class="diffmod">so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective</ins> of the<ins class="diffins">
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of</ins> whether<ins class="diffins"> it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or

modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
