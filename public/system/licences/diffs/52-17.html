</ins><span><ins class="diffmod">This Prince George Open Data Catalogue is offered</ins> to <del class="diffmod">assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
considered responsible for modifications made by others.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
software.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed
book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of
this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any
member of</del><ins class="diffmod">provide</ins> the public <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">with certain information the City has in its files. </ins></span><span><ins class="diffmod">The City now grants you</ins> a <del class="diffmod">licensee,</del><ins class="diffmod">world-wide,</ins> <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">royalty-free,</ins> <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">non-exclusive</ins> <del class="diffmod">addressed as "you".</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document</del><ins class="diffmod">licence</ins> to <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">use,</ins> <del class="diffmod">Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque

passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of
Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one
entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
previously added by you or by arrangement made</del><ins class="diffmod">bound</ins> by the <del class="diffdel">same entity you are
acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffdel">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</del></strong></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else
a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the
various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffdel">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</del></strong></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each
of the documents in all other respects.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
regarding verbatim copying of that document.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffdel">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</del></strong></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a
compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their
being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
Document.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
the Document, </del>then <del class="diffmod">if</del><ins class="diffmod">current</ins> <del class="diffmod">the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
around the whole aggregate.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">8. TRANSLATION</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions</del><ins class="diffmod">version</ins> of these <del class="diffmod">Invariant Sections. You may include
a translation</del><ins class="diffmod">Terms</ins> of <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">Use.</ins> <del class="diffmod">License provided that you also include the original</del></span></li>
<del class="diffmod">English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original English version of this License, the original
English version will prevail.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">9. TERMINATION</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

documents</del></a></h3><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
