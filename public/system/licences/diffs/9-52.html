</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing </ins>any<ins class="diffins"> large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">4. MODIFICATIONS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
other section titles.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization
as the authoritative definition of a standard.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of
Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one
entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else
a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the
various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each
of the documents in all other respects.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
regarding verbatim copying of that document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium,</ins> does not <del class="diffmod">exercise</del><ins class="diffmod">as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a
compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their
being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
around the whole aggregate.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">8. TRANSLATION</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some</ins> or <del class="diffmod">enforce</del><ins class="diffmod">all</ins> <del class="diffmod">any</del><ins class="diffmod">Invariant</ins> <del class="diffmod">legal</del><ins class="diffmod">Sections</ins> <del class="diffmod">right</del><ins class="diffmod">in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include
a translation of this License provided that you also include the original
English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original English version of this License, the original
English version will prevail.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
