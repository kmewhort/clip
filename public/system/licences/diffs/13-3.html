You accept these Datasets on an "as is, where is" basis with all faults and without warranties of 
any kind, and agree to use them solely at your own risk. Without limiting the foregoing, if you learn of

employees, representatives and agents (collectively &ldquo;City Parties&rdquo;) are: (i) not liable on any legal theory 
or basis for any direct, incidental, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages or 
losses, including without limitation, loss of revenue or anticipated profits, loss of goodwill, loss of 
business, loss of data, computer failure or malfunction or any other damages or losses arising from your 
access to, and use of, the Datasets regardless of whether or not such liability or damages arise in 
contract, tort, negligence, equity, statutorily, or otherwise, and even if the City Party has been advised 
of the possibility of such potential liability, in any connection with the Datasets; and (ii) you absolutely 
and irrevocably release City Parties from any claim, demand, litigation, proceeding in connection with 
the foregoing damages that you may incur or suffer. </del></p><del class="diffmod">

which you cause the City to suffer. This means that you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless 
the City Parties from any and all liabilities, demand, litigation, injury, losses, damages and costs 
(including taxes) and all related legal costs and expenses, suffered by the City Parties, incurred in 
connection with any claim arising from: (i) any breach by you of these Terms of Use; (ii) any breach, 
infringement, misappropriation or misuse of any third party intellectual property right resulting from 
your modification, revision or customization of the Datasets; and (iii) any malicious, fraudulent 
(including fraudulent misrepresentation) or criminal conduct (whether by act or omission) by you. You 
agree to cooperate fully in the defence of any such claim. The City reserves the right to assume, at its 
own expense, the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by 
you. You agree not to settle any matter without the written consent of the City. </del></p><del class="diffmod">

in connection with, the Datasets without notice and for any reason, including anything which the City, in 
its sole discretion, believes is a breach of these Terms of Use or is otherwise unlawful or harmful to 
others. In the event of cancellation or suspension of such license, you will no longer be authorized to use 
or reproduce these Datasets, and the City may use any means possible to enforce its decision. Such 
cancellation or suspension will not affect any person who has received the Datasets from you and who is 
otherwise in compliance with these Terms of Use.  </del></p><del class="diffmod">

or imply an association or affiliation with the City. </del></p><del class="diffmod">
 
</del><h2><del class="diffmod">No Waiver</del></h2><del class="diffmod">
</del><p><del class="diffmod">You agree that, if the City does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy contained in these 
Terms of Use (or that the City has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a 
formal waiver of the City's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to the City. Any 
waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use will be effective only if the City expressly states in a signed 
writing that it is waiving a specified provision. </del></p><del class="diffmod">
