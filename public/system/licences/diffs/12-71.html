</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">The position of the dedicator of the work</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Copyright law, as with most other law under the banner of &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;, is inherently national law. This means that there exists several differences in how copyright and other IP rights can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world. This is despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection. The internet and other communication technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights, for use by the global community. Because of this feature of intellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to license these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the public domain. Unlike licences for free and open source software, free cultural works, or open content licences, rightsholders will not be able to &ldquo;dual license&rdquo; their work by releasing the same work under different licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they choose. Rightsholders therefore can&rsquo;t re-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license. Doing so creates truly accessible data to build rich applications and advance the progress of science and the arts.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">This document can cover either or both of the database and its contents (the data). Because databases can have a wide variety of content &ndash; not just factual data &ndash; rightsholders should use the Open Data Commons &ndash; Public Domain Dedication &amp; Licence for an entire database and its contents only if everything can be placed under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can sometimes have intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use this licence to cover both the database and its factual data when making material available under this document; even if it is likely that the data would not be covered by copyright or database rights.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Rightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database rights claims over only a database, and leave the contents to be covered by other licences or documents. They can do this because this document refers to the &ldquo;Work&rdquo;, which can be either &ndash; or both &ndash; the database and its contents. As a result, rightsholders need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this document when they dedicate it.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Just like any licence or other document dealing with intellectual property, rightsholders should be aware that one can only license what one owns. Please</ins> ensure that the<del class="diffdel"> 
recipients</del> <del class="diffmod">of</del><ins class="diffmod">rights</ins> <del class="diffmod">these</del><ins class="diffmod">have</ins> <del class="diffmod">data</del><ins class="diffmod">been</ins> <del class="diffmod">sets</del><ins class="diffmod">cleared</ins> <del class="diffmod">give</del><ins class="diffmod">to</ins> <del class="diffmod">back</del><ins class="diffmod">make this material available under this document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">This document permanently and irrevocably makes the Work available</ins> to the <del class="diffmod">community</del><ins class="diffmod">public for any use of any kind, and it should not be used unless</ins> the <del class="diffmod">benefits</del><ins class="diffmod">rightsholder</ins> <del class="diffmod">they
