  Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now

  applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
  future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
  including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the

  large</del><ins class="diffmod">is a licensee,</ins> and<ins class="diffins"> is addressed as "you".</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document</ins> to the <del class="diffmod">detriment</del><ins class="diffmod">Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Affirmer's</del><ins class="diffmod">mathematics,</ins> <del class="diffmod">heirs</del><ins class="diffmod">a
Secondary</ins> <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">Section</ins> <del class="diffmod">successors, fully intending that

matter of historical connection with the</ins> subject <del class="diffdel">to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
  </del>or <del class="diffmod">any</del><ins class="diffmod">with</ins> <del class="diffmod">other</del><ins class="diffmod">related</ins> <del class="diffmod">legal</del><ins class="diffmod">matters,</ins> or <del class="diffmod">equitable</del><ins class="diffmod">of

them.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in</ins> the <del class="diffmod">quiet</del><ins class="diffmod">notice</ins> <del class="diffmod">enjoyment</del><ins class="diffmod">that says that
the Document is released under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Transparent" copy</ins> of the <del class="diffmod">Work</del><ins class="diffmod">Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification</ins> by<ins class="diffins"> readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">2. VERBATIM COPYING</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">4. MODIFICATIONS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><ul><ins class="diffins">
</ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">A.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a
    title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
    versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
    of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
    original publisher of that version gives permission.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">B.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more
