  effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of
  the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable
  law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of
  the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
