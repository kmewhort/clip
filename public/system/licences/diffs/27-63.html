  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software,</ins> and <del class="diffmod">subsequent</del><ins class="diffmod">to</ins> <del class="diffmod">owner(s)
  (each</del><ins class="diffmod">any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs;</ins> and <del class="diffmod">all,</del><ins class="diffmod">that you know you can do these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><h3><a id="SEC3"><ins class="diffmod">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</ins></a></h3><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">0.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
 This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">1.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">

 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">2.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, --><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">a)</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
     The modified work must itself be a software library.
</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">b)</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
     You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">c)</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
     You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">d)</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
     If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by</ins> an <del class="diffmod">"owner")</del><ins class="diffmod">application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.
     </ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent</ins> of <del class="diffmod">an</del><ins class="diffmod">the
     application.  Therefore,</ins> <del class="diffmod">original</del><ins class="diffmod">Subsection 2d requires that any
     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
     root function must still compute square roots.)</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins></ul><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">3.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
 You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">4.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
 You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

 A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
