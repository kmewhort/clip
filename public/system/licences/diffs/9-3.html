  risk.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

  </del><h2><del class="diffmod">Exclusion of Liability</del></h2><del class="diffmod">

  claim arising from any breach by you of these Terms of Use, including reasonable legal
  fees and costs. You agree to cooperate fully in the defence of any such claim. The City

  without notice and for any reason, including anything which the City, in its sole
  discretion, believes is a breach of these Terms of Use or is otherwise unlawful or
  harmful to others. In the event of cancellation or suspension, you will no longer be
  authorized to use or reproduce these datasets, and the City may use any means possible
  to enforce its decision. Such cancellation or suspension will not affect any person who
  has received the datasets from you and who is otherwise in compliance with these Terms

  City.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

  </del><h2><del class="diffmod">No Waiver</del></h2><del class="diffmod">

  </del><p><del class="diffmod">You agree that, if the City does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
  contained in these Terms of Use (or that the City has the benefit of under any
  applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of the City's rights and
