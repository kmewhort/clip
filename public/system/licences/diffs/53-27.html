  A "Modified Version"</del><ins class="diffmod">enjoyment</ins> of the <del class="diffmod">Document means any work containing the
  Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
  modifications and/or translated into another language.
</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
  the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
  publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
  (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
  within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
  textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
  mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
  connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
  commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
  them.
</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
  are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
  that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
  section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
  allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
  Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
  Sections then there are none.
</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
  as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
  the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
  be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the
  general public, that is suitable for revising the document
  straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
  pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
  drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
  for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
  to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
  format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
  or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
  An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
  of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
  ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
  or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
  HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
  transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
  include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only</del><ins class="diffmod">Work</ins> by
  <del class="diffdel">proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
  processing tools are not generally available, and the
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
  processors for output purposes only.
</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
  plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
  this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
  formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
  the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
  preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
  title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
  text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
  specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
  "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
  of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
  section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">
  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
  states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
  Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
  License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
  implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
  no effect on the meaning of this License.

  </del><strong><del class="diffdel">2. VERBATIM COPYING</del></strong><del class="diffdel">
</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
  commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
  copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
  to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
  conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
  technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
  copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
  compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
  number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
  you may publicly display copies.

  </del><strong><del class="diffdel">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</del></strong><del class="diffdel">
</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
  printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
  Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
  copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
  Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
  the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
  you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
  the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
  visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
  the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
  as verbatim copying in other respects.
</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
  legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
  reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
  pages.
</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
  more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
  copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
  a computer-network location from which the general network-using
  public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
  a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
  when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
  that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
  location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
  Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
  edition to the public.
</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">
  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
  them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
  the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
  the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified

  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
  versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
  Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
  list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
  license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
  multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
  copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
  different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
  adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
  author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
  Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"

  Entitled "Endorsements."

  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this

  the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
  verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
  and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
  resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
  of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
  apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
  derivative works of the Document.
</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
  copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
  the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
  covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
  electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
  aggregate.

  </del><strong><del class="diffmod">8. TRANSLATION</del></strong><del class="diffmod">

</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
  distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
  permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
  translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
  original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
  translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
  Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
  the original English version of this License and the original versions
  of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
  the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
  or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
  "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
  its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
  title.

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
  as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
  copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
  automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
  parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
  License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
  parties remain in full compliance.

  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
  License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
