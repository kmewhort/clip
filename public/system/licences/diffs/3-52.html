Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</ins></pre><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">0. PREAMBLE</ins></strong></p>

<p><del class="diffmod">Redistribution</del><ins class="diffmod">The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy</ins> and <del class="diffmod">use</del><ins class="diffmod">redistribute</ins> <del class="diffmod">in source and binary forms,</del><ins class="diffmod">it,</ins> with or without <del class="diffmod">modification,</del><ins class="diffmod">modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
considered responsible for modifications made by others.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
software.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed
book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of
this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any
member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles</ins> are
<del class="diffmod">permitted</del><ins class="diffmod">designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">2. VERBATIM COPYING</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially,</ins> provided that <ins class="diffins">this License, </ins>the <del class="diffmod">following</del><ins class="diffmod">copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other</ins> conditions <del class="diffmod">are</del><ins class="diffmod">whatsoever</ins> <del class="diffmod">met:</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><ol><del class="diffmod">
</del><li><del class="diffmod">Redistributions</del><ins class="diffmod">to those</ins> of <del class="diffmod">source</del><ins class="diffmod">this
License.</ins> <del class="diffmod">code</del><ins class="diffmod">You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you</ins> must <del class="diffmod">retain</del><ins class="diffmod">also follow</ins> the <del class="diffmod">above</del><ins class="diffmod">conditions in section 3.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">4. MODIFICATIONS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><ul><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">A.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod"> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a
    title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
    versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
    of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
    original publisher of that version gives permission.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

  </ins><li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">B.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod"> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more
    persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
    Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of
    the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">
  </ins><li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">C.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod"> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of
    the Modified Version, as the publisher.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">
  </ins><li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">D.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod"> Preserve all the</ins> copyright <del class="diffmod">notice,</del><ins class="diffmod">notices of the
  Document.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">E.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod"> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
    modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

  </ins><li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">F.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod"> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
    license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
    under the terms of</ins> this<ins class="diffins"> License, in the form shown in the Addendum
  below.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">G.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of
    Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
    notice.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">H.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> Include an unaltered copy of this License.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">I.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> Preserve the section entitled "History", and its
    title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
    and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there
    is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the
    title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title
    Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
    previous sentence.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">J.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
    Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
    likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
    it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit
    a network location for a work that was published at least four years before
    the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
    to gives permission.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">K.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or
    "Dedications", preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section
    all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
    and/or dedications given therein.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">L.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
    unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
    equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">M.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a
    section may not be included in the Modified Version.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

  </ins><li><ins class="diffins">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffins">N.</ins></strong><ins class="diffins"> Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
    or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
</ins></ul><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
other section titles.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization
as the authoritative definition of a standard.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of
Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one
entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else
a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the</ins> list of
<del class="diffmod">conditions</del><ins class="diffmod">Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the
various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each
of the documents in all other respects.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
regarding verbatim copying of that document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a
compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their
being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
around the whole aggregate.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">8. TRANSLATION</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include
a translation of this License provided that you also include the original
English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the
translation</ins> and the <del class="diffmod">following</del><ins class="diffmod">original</ins> <del class="diffmod">disclaimer.</del></li><ins class="diffmod">English version of this License, the original
English version will prevail.</ins></p>

<li><del class="diffmod">Redistributions</del><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">9. TERMINATION</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain</ins> in <del class="diffmod">binary</del><ins class="diffmod">full</ins> <del class="diffmod">form</del><ins class="diffmod">compliance.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of</ins> this <del class="diffmod">list</del><ins class="diffmod">License "or any</ins>
