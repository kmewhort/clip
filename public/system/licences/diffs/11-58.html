  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public</ins> License <del class="diffmod">Agreement</del></h1><del class="diffmod">

  </del><p><del class="diffmod">This</del><ins class="diffmod">applies</ins> <del class="diffmod">Agreement</del><ins class="diffmod">to</ins> <del class="diffmod">is between Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented
  by the Minister</del><ins class="diffmod">most</ins> of the <del class="diffmod">department</del><ins class="diffmod">Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code</ins> or <del class="diffmod">head</del><ins class="diffmod">can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies</ins> of the <del class="diffmod">Crown</del><ins class="diffmod">software,</ins> <del class="diffmod">corporation</del><ins class="diffmod">or</ins> <del class="diffmod">providing</del><ins class="diffmod">if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give</ins> the <del class="diffmod">Data</del><ins class="diffmod">recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p>
  <del class="diffmod">(referred</del><ins class="diffmod">We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission</ins> to <del class="diffmod">herein</del><ins class="diffmod">copy,
distribute</ins> <del class="diffmod">as</del><ins class="diffmod">and/or</ins> <del class="diffmod">"Licensor"</del><ins class="diffmod">modify</ins> <del class="diffmod">)</del><ins class="diffmod">the software.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

  Also, for each author's protection</ins> and <del class="diffmod">you</del><ins class="diffmod">ours,</ins> <del class="diffmod">(either</del><ins class="diffmod">we</ins> <del class="diffmod">an</del><ins class="diffmod">want</ins> <del class="diffmod">individual</del><ins class="diffmod">to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use</ins> or <del class="diffmod">a</del><ins class="diffmod">not</ins> <del class="diffmod">legal</del><ins class="diffmod">licensed</ins> <del class="diffmod">entity</del><ins class="diffmod">at all.

      If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License

those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or</ins> of any <del class="diffmod">continuing</del><ins class="diffmod">later version published by the Free

of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
