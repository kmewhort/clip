</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or
without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later
version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of
using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of
propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in
accord with the license of GCC.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or
virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable
for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase.
Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format
that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for
producing a compiler intermediate representation.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code.  Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone
or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using
any work based</ins> on <del class="diffmod">behalf</del><ins class="diffmod">GCC.  For example, using non-GPL-compatible
Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not
qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes.  You
