cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By
contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
remains free software for all its users.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

of works, such as semiconductor masks.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">To "modify" </ins>a <del class="diffmod">work,</del><ins class="diffmod">work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options,</ins> such as a<ins class="diffins">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><a name="section1"></a><ins class="diffmod">1. Source Code.</ins></h4><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component,</ins> or <del class="diffmod">encyclopedia,</del><ins class="diffmod">to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public</ins> in<ins class="diffins"> source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on</ins> which the <del class="diffmod">Work</del><ins class="diffmod">executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Corresponding Source" for a work</ins> in <del class="diffmod">its</del><ins class="diffmod">object</ins> <del class="diffmod">entirety</del><ins class="diffmod">code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified</ins> in <ins class="diffins">performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the </ins>unmodified <del class="diffmod">form,</del><ins class="diffmod">Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><a name="section3"></a><ins class="diffmod">3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</ins></h4><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
