Redistribution</del><ins class="diffmod">Domain Dedication &amp; Licence is a document intended to allow you to freely share, modify,</ins> and use <ins class="diffins">this work for any purpose and without any restrictions. This licence is intended for use on databases or their contents (&ldquo;data&rdquo;), either together or individually.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Many databases are covered by copyright. Some jurisdictions, mainly </ins>in<ins class="diffins"> Europe, have specific special rights that cover databases called the &ldquo;sui generis&rdquo; database right. Both of these sets of rights, as well as other legal rights used to protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or practical difficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying data but retain a limited amount of rights under a &ldquo;some rights reserved&rdquo; approach to licensing as outlined in the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data. As a result, this waiver and licence tries to the fullest extent possible to eliminate or fully license any rights that cover this database and data. Any Community Norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form a part of this document, and do not act as a contract for access or other terms of use for the database or data.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">The position of the recipient of the work</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Because this document places the database and its contents in or as close as possible within the public domain, there are no restrictions or requirements placed on the recipient by this document. Recipients may use this work commercially, use technical protection measures, combine this data or database with other databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep them secret. It is not a requirement that recipients provide further users with a copy of this licence or attribute the original creator of the data or database as a source. The goal is to eliminate restrictions held by the original creator of the data and database on the use of it by others.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">The position of the dedicator of the work</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Copyright law, as with most other law under the banner of &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;, is inherently national law. This means that there exists several differences in how copyright and other IP rights can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world. This is despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection. The internet and other communication technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights, for use by the global community. Because of this feature of intellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to license these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the public domain. Unlike licences for free and open</ins> source <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">software,</ins> <del class="diffmod">binary</del><ins class="diffmod">free</ins> <del class="diffmod">forms,</del><ins class="diffmod">cultural</ins> <del class="diffmod">with</del><ins class="diffmod">works,</ins> or <del class="diffmod">without

modification,</del><ins class="diffmod">open</ins> <del class="diffmod">are</del><ins class="diffmod">content</ins> <del class="diffmod">permitted</del><ins class="diffmod">licences,</ins> <del class="diffmod">provided</del><ins class="diffmod">rightsholders will not be able to &ldquo;dual license&rdquo; their work by releasing the same work under different licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they choose. Rightsholders therefore can&rsquo;t re-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license. Doing so creates truly accessible data to build rich applications and advance the progress of science and the arts.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">This document can cover either or both of the database and its contents (the data). Because databases can have a wide variety of content &ndash; not just factual data &ndash; rightsholders should use the Open Data Commons &ndash; Public Domain Dedication &amp; Licence for an entire database and its contents only if everything can be placed under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can sometimes have intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use this licence to cover both the database and its factual data when making material available under this document; even if it is likely</ins> that the <del class="diffmod">following</del><ins class="diffmod">data</ins> <del class="diffmod">conditions</del><ins class="diffmod">would not be covered by copyright or database rights.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Rightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database rights claims over only a database, and leave the contents to be covered by other licences or documents. They can do this because this document refers to the &ldquo;Work&rdquo;, which can be either &ndash; or both &ndash; the database and its contents. As a result, rightsholders need to clearly state what they</ins> are <del class="diffmod">met:
</del><br><br><del class="diffmod">
1.</del><ins class="diffmod">dedicating</ins> <del class="diffmod">Redistributions</del><ins class="diffmod">under this document when they dedicate it.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Just like any licence or other document dealing with intellectual property, rightsholders should be aware that one can only license what one owns. Please ensure that the rights have been cleared to make this material available under this document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">This document permanently and irrevocably makes the Work available to the public for any use</ins> of <del class="diffmod">source</del><ins class="diffmod">any</ins> <del class="diffmod">code</del><ins class="diffmod">kind,</ins> <del class="diffmod">must</del><ins class="diffmod">and</ins> <del class="diffmod">retain</del><ins class="diffmod">it should not be used unless the rightsholder is prepared for this to happen.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">2.1.</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod"> Legal effect of this Document.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod"> This Document is:</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">a. A dedication to the public domain and waiver of Copyright and Database Rights over the Work; and</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">b. A licence of Copyright and Database Rights over the Work in jurisdictions that do not allow for relinquishment or waiver.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">2.2. </ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">Legal rights covered.</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">a. </ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">Copyright</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Work. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Data stored in the Database. Copyright may also cover the Data depending on the jurisdiction and type of Data; and</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">b. </ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">Database Rights</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">. Database Rights only extend to the extraction and re-utilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the Data. Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Data is removed from the Database and is selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">2.2 </ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">Rights not covered. </ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">
