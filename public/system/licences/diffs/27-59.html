</ins><p>The <del class="diffmod">laws</del><ins class="diffmod">licenses for most software and other practical works are designed

  Copyright</del><ins class="diffmod">use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs,</ins> and <del class="diffmod">Related</del><ins class="diffmod">that</ins> <del class="diffmod">Rights</del><ins class="diffmod">you</ins> <del class="diffmod">(defined</del><ins class="diffmod">know</ins> <del class="diffmod">below)</del><ins class="diffmod">you</ins> <del class="diffmod">upon</del><ins class="diffmod">can do these things.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender</ins> the <del class="diffmod">creator</del><ins class="diffmod">rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software,</ins> and <del class="diffmod">subsequent</del><ins class="diffmod">(2)</ins> <del class="diffmod">owner(s)
  (each</del><ins class="diffmod">offer you this License

that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors</ins> of <del class="diffmod">an</del><ins class="diffmod">previous</ins> <del class="diffmod">original</del><ins class="diffmod">versions.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Some</ins> <del class="diffmod">work</del><ins class="diffmod">devices are designed to deny users access to install or run

  "Work").</del><ins class="diffmod">the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</ins></p><del class="diffmod">

</ins><p><del class="diffmod">Certain</del><ins class="diffmod">Finally,</ins> <del class="diffmod">owners</del><ins class="diffmod">every program is threatened constantly by software patents.

permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a

the interface presents a list of user commands</ins> or <del class="diffmod">she</del><ins class="diffmod">options, such as a

</ins><a name="section1"></a><ins class="diffmod">1. Source Code.</ins></h4><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source
form of a work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either</ins> is an <del class="diffmod">owner</del><ins class="diffmod">official

is widely used among developers working in that language.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><a name="section3"></a><ins class="diffmod">3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</ins></h4><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><a name="section4"></a><ins class="diffmod">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</ins></h4><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><a name="section5"></a><ins class="diffmod">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</ins></h4><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><ul><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins></ul><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License</ins> to apply <del class="diffmod">CC0</del><ins class="diffmod">to the other
parts of the aggregate.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><a name="section6"></a><ins class="diffmod">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</ins></h4><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><ul><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next</ins> to the <del class="diffmod">Work</del><ins class="diffmod">object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided

tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of </ins>its <del class="diffmod">terms,</del><ins class="diffmod">Corresponding Source.  The information must

copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the

transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
