</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to
allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while
maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by
copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some
jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that
cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,
the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Use</del></h2><ins class="diffmod">this Database to</ins>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 12px;"><del class="diffmod">By</del><ins class="diffmod">act</ins> <del class="diffmod">using</del><ins class="diffmod">in certain ways in return for accessing</ins> this <del class="diffmod">website</del><ins class="diffmod">Database.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),
and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the
contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL
together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a
single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the
contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should
describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual
record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,
trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights
over information in the contents), and so</ins> you are <del class="diffmod">agreeing</del><ins class="diffmod">advised that you may
have</ins> to<ins class="diffins"> consult other documents or clear other rights before doing
activities not covered by this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. A license of the Database Right; and</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the
Database, including:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.
  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the
  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents
  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright
  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database
  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation
  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table
  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of
  Contents stored in the Database;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.
  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the
      Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed
  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would
  not infringe any applicable copyright; and</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for
  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of
  use on this access as outlined in this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">2.3 Rights not covered.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making
  or operation of the Database;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the
  Database; and</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the
      Database.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of
the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,
including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality
rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database
Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.
For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this
License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could
have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of
the rights over the images.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor
grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but
only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of
any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly
include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To
the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the
future.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The rights granted cover, for example:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of
  the Contents;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. Creation of Derivative Databases;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. Creation of Collective Databases;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and
  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative
  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in
  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective
      Databases.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
  of the rights granted under this License;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
  the rights granted under this License; and,</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
  granted under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that
this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice
of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section
10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to
Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important
conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be
in material breach of its terms.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You
must:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license
  permitted under Section 4.4;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license
  permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the
  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices
  that refer to this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular
  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a
  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to
  look for it.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced
Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you
Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with
the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,
views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced
Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it
is available under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under
  Section 4.3:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><pre><code><ins class="diffins">    Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available
    here under the Open Database License (ODbL).
</ins></code></pre><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
hyperlink to the URI of the Database. &ldquo;Open Database License&rdquo; should
contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If
hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the
required URI&rsquo;s with the above notice.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">4.4 Share alike.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under
  the terms of:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">           i. This License;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">           ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">           iii. A compatible license.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses
  mentioned in (iii), You must</ins> comply with <ins class="diffins">the terms of that license.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the
  whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a
  Derivative Database </ins>and<ins class="diffins"> must comply with Section 4.4.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works.  A Derivative Database is
  Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work
  created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,
  You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a
  that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine
  compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the
  authorised proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a compatible
  license grants You permission to use the compatible license.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">4.5 Limits of Share Alike.  The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply
in the following:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license
  Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this
  Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License
  still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of
  the Collective Database;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as
  part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not
  create a Derivative Database for purposes of  Section 4.4; and</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is
  not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements
  of Section 4.4.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative
Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also
offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy
in a machine readable form of:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. The entire Derivative Database; or</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or
  the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an
  algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the
  differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be
available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical
distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">4.7 Technological measures and additional terms</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to
  Section 4.7 b.)  any terms or any technological measures on the
  Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of
  the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any
  rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting
  the ability of any person to exercise those rights.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological
  measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a
  Substantial part of the Contents (a &ldquo;Restricted Database&rdquo;) in
  contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the
  Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the
  Restricted Database:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">           i. That is available without additional fee;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">           ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict
    the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have
    the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to
    exercise those rights (an &ldquo;Unrestricted Database&rdquo;); and</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">           iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the
    recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">      c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a
  Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a
  password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You
  do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights
  granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the
  ability of any person to exercise those rights.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time
You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the
Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same
terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may
enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are
solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made
by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed
under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
