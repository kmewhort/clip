  Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
  known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
  the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
  applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
  future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
  including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
  "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at
  large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
  such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
  or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by
  the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</del><ins class="diffmod">Project.</ins></p><del class="diffdel">

  shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's
  express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
  Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
  sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise
  Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide,
  (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
  time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies,
  and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
  advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed
  effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of
  the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable
  law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of
  the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
  case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</del></p><del class="diffdel">
