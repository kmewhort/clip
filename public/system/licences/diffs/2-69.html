</del><p><del class="diffmod">A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they

encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.

letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to

in one of these ways:</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><ul><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no

</del><li><del class="diffmod">c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the

    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,

into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,

code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a

adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer

get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
