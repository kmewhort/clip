document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not

have the freedom to distribute copies of</ins> free<ins class="diffins"> software (and charge for</ins>
<del class="diffmod">software.</del><ins class="diffmod">them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new

License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed

instruction or reference.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
placed</del><ins class="diffmod">encouraged</ins> by the <del class="diffmod">copyright</del><ins class="diffmod">resulting</ins> <del class="diffmod">holder</del><ins class="diffmod">cooperation.  However,</ins> <del class="diffmod">saying</del><ins class="diffmod">in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access</ins> it <del class="diffmod">can</del><ins class="diffmod">on</ins> <del class="diffmod">be</del><ins class="diffmod">a</ins> <del class="diffmod">distributed</del><ins class="diffmod">server</ins> <del class="diffmod">under</del><ins class="diffmod">without ever releasing its
source code to</ins> the <del class="diffmod">terms</del><ins class="diffmod">public.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator</ins> of<ins class="diffins"> a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under</ins>
this <del class="diffmod">License. </del><ins class="diffmod">license.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.</ins></p>

<p>A <del class="diffmod">"Modified</del><ins class="diffmod">"covered</ins> <del class="diffmod">Version"</del><ins class="diffmod">work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as</del><ins class="diffmod">so</ins> long as <del class="diffmod">they</del><ins class="diffmod">your</ins> <del class="diffmod">preserve</del><ins class="diffmod">license otherwise remains

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If the required texts</del><ins class="diffmod">exclusively</ins> for <del class="diffmod">either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,

with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

    with subsection 6b.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided

    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly

</ins><a name="section9"></a><ins class="diffins">9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</ins></h4><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffins">
</ins><a name="section10"></a><ins class="diffins">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</ins></h4><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffins">
</ins><a name="section11"></a><ins class="diffins">11. Patents.</ins></h4><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffins">
</ins><a name="section12"></a><ins class="diffins">12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</ins></h4><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding

from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
