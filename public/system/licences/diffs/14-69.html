    </ins><p><ins class="diffins">a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright
    licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the

    Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of
    the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data
    entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the Database;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

    </ins><p><ins class="diffins">b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
    Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database Rights
    can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also
    apply when the Contents are removed from the Database and are selected and arranged
    in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright; and</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

    cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents
    contained in the Database. For example, if used on a Database of images (the
    Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which

    </ins><p><ins class="diffins">4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work does
    not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a Produced Work,

    to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative
