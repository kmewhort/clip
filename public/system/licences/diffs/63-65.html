<p>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public

  This license, the <del class="diffmod">Library</del><ins class="diffmod">Lesser</ins> General Public License, applies to some
specially designated <ins class="diffins">software packages--typically libraries--of the
</ins>Free Software Foundation <del class="diffdel">software, </del>and <del class="diffdel">to any
</del>other <del class="diffmod">libraries</del><ins class="diffmod">authors</ins> <del class="diffmod">whose authors</del><ins class="diffmod">who</ins> decide to use it.  You<del class="diffmod"> </del><ins class="diffmod">

strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</ins>
</p>

<p><del class="diffmod">

  </del><ins class="diffmod">
  </ins>When we speak of free software, we are referring to <del class="diffmod">freedom,</del><ins class="diffmod">freedom</ins> <ins class="diffins">of use,

</del><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<del class="diffmod">anyone</del><ins class="diffmod">distributors</ins> to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender <del class="diffmod">the </del><ins class="diffmod">these

</p><del class="diffmod">

</del><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link <del class="diffmod">a</del><ins class="diffmod">other</ins> <del class="diffmod">program</del><ins class="diffmod">code</ins> with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the <del class="diffmod">recipients</del><ins class="diffmod">recipients,</ins> so that they can relink them
with the <del class="diffmod">library,</del><ins class="diffmod">library</ins> after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<ins class="diffins">
ordinary</ins> <del class="diffdel">ordinary
</del>GNU General Public <del class="diffmod">License, which was designed for utility programs.</del><ins class="diffmod">License.</ins>  This<del class="diffmod">

<del class="diffmod">one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.
</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  The reason we have a separate public</del><ins class="diffmod">this</ins> license for <del class="diffmod">some</del><ins class="diffmod">certain</ins> libraries <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">in</ins> <del class="diffmod">that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding</del><ins class="diffmod">order</ins> to <del class="diffmod">a</del><ins class="diffmod">permit linking those</ins>
<del class="diffmod">program</del><ins class="diffmod">libraries</ins> <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">into</ins> <del class="diffmod">simply</del><ins class="diffmod">non-free</ins> <del class="diffmod">using it.  Linking</del><ins class="diffmod">programs.

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  When</ins> a program<ins class="diffins"> is linked</ins> with a library, <del class="diffmod">without</del><ins class="diffmod">whether statically or using</ins>
<del class="diffmod">changing</del><ins class="diffmod">a shared library,</ins> the <del class="diffmod">library,</del><ins class="diffmod">combination of the two</ins> is <del class="diffmod">in</del><ins class="diffmod">legally</ins> <del class="diffmod">some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running</del><ins class="diffmod">speaking</ins> a<del class="diffdel"> utility program or application program.  However, in</del>
<del class="diffdel">a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a </del>combined work, a<del class="diffmod">
</del><ins class="diffmod"> </ins>derivative of the original <del class="diffmod">library,</del><ins class="diffmod">library.  The</ins> <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use</ins> the ordinary General Public License<ins class="diffins"> for many</ins>
<del class="diffmod">treats</del><ins class="diffmod">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that</ins> it <del class="diffmod">as</del><ins class="diffmod">becomes
a</ins> <del class="diffmod">such.</del><ins class="diffmod">de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</ins>
</p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  Because</del><ins class="diffmod">allowed</ins> <del class="diffmod">of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not</del><ins class="diffmod">to</ins> use the <del class="diffmod">libraries.</del><ins class="diffmod">library.</ins>  <del class="diffmod">We
concluded</del><ins class="diffmod">A more frequent case is</ins> that <del class="diffmod">weaker</del><ins class="diffmod">a</ins> <del class="diffmod">conditions</del><ins class="diffmod">free

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number</ins> of <ins class="diffins">people to use a large body of

  </ins>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
</p>
<p>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<del class="diffmod">
</del><ins class="diffmod">

</ins></p>
<p>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
</p>
<p>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong><del class="diffmod">

 </del><ins class="diffmod">
</ins>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
</p>
<p>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.<del class="diffmod">

 </del><ins class="diffmod">

</ins>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
</p>
<p>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
</p>
<p>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.<del class="diffmod">

</del><ins class="diffmod">
</ins></p>
<p>
<strong>4.</strong><del class="diffmod">
 </del><ins class="diffmod">
</ins>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
</p>
<p>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<del class="diffmod">
</del><ins class="diffmod">

</ins></p>
<p>
<strong>5.</strong><del class="diffmod">
 </del><ins class="diffmod">
</ins>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
</p><del class="diffmod">

</del><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
</p>
<p>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
</p>
<p>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<del class="diffmod">
</del><ins class="diffmod">

</ins></p>
<p>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
</p>
<p>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference

generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

<p>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).
</p>
<p>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
