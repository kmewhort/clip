        </del><ol type="a"><del class="diffmod">
</del><li><del class="diffmod">You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
          under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
          of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
          License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
          on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
          the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
          rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
          License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
          intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
          disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
          effective technological measures on the Work that
          restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
          to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
          the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
          the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
          not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
          be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
          create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
          must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
          Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
          requested.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

          pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
          notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
          medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
          Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
          supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
          designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
          institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
          ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
          terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name

          supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
          URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated
          with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
          copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
          The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be

          that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such

          authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these

          avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
          by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
          manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
          this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
          or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
