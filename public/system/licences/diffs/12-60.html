</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</ins>
<ins class="diffins">to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</ins>
<br><a href="#Your_open_license_to_the_data_sets"><del class="diffmod">*</del><ins class="diffmod">price.  Our</ins> <del class="diffmod">Your</del><ins class="diffmod">General</ins> <del class="diffmod">open</del><ins class="diffmod">Public</ins> <del class="diffmod">license</del><ins class="diffmod">Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on</ins> to the<del class="diffdel"> 
datasets</del></a><br><a href="#Giving_City_credit"><del class="diffdel">*</del> <del class="diffmod">Giving</del><ins class="diffmod">recipients</ins> <del class="diffmod">City</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">credit</del></a><br><a href="#Future_changes_to_data_sets/Terms_of_Use"><del class="diffmod">*</del><ins class="diffmod">same

or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission</ins> to<del class="diffmod"> 
datasets/Terms</del><ins class="diffmod"> copy, distribute and/or modify it.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Use</del></a><br><a href="#Compliance_with_law_-_Your_responsibility"><del class="diffmod">*</del><ins class="diffmod">previous</ins> <del class="diffmod">Compliance</del><ins class="diffmod">versions.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible</ins> with <del class="diffmod">law</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">- 
Your</del><ins class="diffmod">aim</ins> <del class="diffmod">responsibility</del><ins class="diffmod">of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

modification follow.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
 
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the
earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo;

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffins">
</ins><a name="section3"></a><ins class="diffins">3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</ins></h4><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffins">
</ins><a name="section4"></a><ins class="diffins">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</ins></h4><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffins">
</ins><a name="section5"></a><ins class="diffins">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</ins></h4><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><ul><ins class="diffins">
</ins><li><ins class="diffins">a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

</ins><li><ins class="diffins">b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

</ins><li><ins class="diffins">c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

</ins><li><ins class="diffins">d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

</ins></ul><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><h4><ins class="diffins">
</ins><a name="section6"></a><ins class="diffins">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</ins></h4><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><ul><ins class="diffins">
</ins><li><ins class="diffins">a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

</ins><li><ins class="diffins">b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

</ins><li><ins class="diffins">c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

</ins><li><ins class="diffins">d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">

</ins><li><ins class="diffins">e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.</ins></li><ins class="diffins">
</ins></ul><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to</ins> ensure that the<del class="diffmod"> 
recipients</del><ins class="diffmod"> continued functioning</ins> of <del class="diffmod">these</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">data</del><ins class="diffmod">modified</ins> <del class="diffmod">sets</del><ins class="diffmod">object

modification has been made.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred</ins> to the <del class="diffmod">community</del><ins class="diffmod">recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how</ins> the <del class="diffmod">benefits</del><ins class="diffmod">transaction</ins> <del class="diffmod">they 
derive</del><ins class="diffmod">is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge</ins> for <del class="diffmod">each</del><ins class="diffmod">exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for

License of the Program </ins>or <del class="diffmod">reproduction</del><ins class="diffmod">a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License,</ins> of<del class="diffmod"> 
</del><ins class="diffmod"> making, using, or selling its contributor version,

purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
