<p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. </p>

<p><strong>1. Definitions</strong> </p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<strong>"Collective Work"</strong> means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
</li>

<li><del class="diffmod">
</del><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><strong>"Derivative Work"</strong> means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.<del class="diffmod">

<li>
<strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.

<strong>"Work"</strong> means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.<del class="diffmod">

</del><ins class="diffmod">
</ins></li>

<li>
<strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. Fair Use Rights.</strong> Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. </p>
