</del><p><del class="diffmod">The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds</del><ins class="diffmod">District</ins> of <del class="diffmod">works,</del><ins class="diffmod">North</ins> <del class="diffmod">specifically</del><ins class="diffmod">Vancouver&acirc;&euro;&trade;s</ins> <del class="diffmod">designed</del><ins class="diffmod">GIS</ins> <del class="diffmod">to</del><ins class="diffmod">website.</ins> <del class="diffdel">ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By
contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
remains free software for all its users.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><h3><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="terms"></a><del class="diffdel">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</del></h3><del class="diffdel">

</del><h4><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="section0"></a><del class="diffdel">0. Definitions.</del></h4><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><h4><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="section1"></a><del class="diffdel">1. Source Code.</del></h4><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><h4><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="section2"></a><del class="diffdel">2. Basic Permissions.</del></h4><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><h4><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="section3"></a><del class="diffdel">3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</del></h4><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p>When you<ins class="diffins">
  enter,</ins> <del class="diffmod">convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><h4><del class="diffmod">
</del><a name="section4"></a><del class="diffmod">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</del></h4><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><h4><del class="diffmod">
</del><a name="section5"></a><del class="diffmod">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</del></h4><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><ul><del class="diffmod">
</del><li><del class="diffmod">a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del></ul><del class="diffmod">
</del><p><del class="diffmod">A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><h4><del class="diffmod">
</del><a name="section6"></a><del class="diffmod">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</del></h4><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><ul><del class="diffmod">
</del><li><del class="diffmod">a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del></ul><del class="diffmod">
</del><p><del class="diffmod">A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession</del><ins class="diffmod">display,</ins> and use <del class="diffmod">of</del><ins class="diffmod">this</ins> <del class="diffmod">the

Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</del><ins class="diffmod">Use.</ins></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><ins class="diffmod">

  </ins><h2><ins class="diffmod">Website</ins></h2><ins class="diffmod">

  </ins><p>The <del class="diffmod">requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation</del><ins class="diffmod">District</ins> of <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">North</ins> <del class="diffmod">network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><h4><del class="diffmod">
</del><a name="section7"></a><del class="diffmod">7. Additional Terms.</del></h4><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><ul><del class="diffmod">
</del><li><del class="diffmod">a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del></ul><del class="diffmod">
</del><p><del class="diffmod">All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further
restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or conveying.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><h4><del class="diffmod">
</del><a name="section8"></a><del class="diffmod">8. Termination.</del></h4><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><h4><del class="diffmod">
</del><a name="section9"></a><del class="diffmod">9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</del></h4><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><h4><del class="diffmod">
</del><a name="section10"></a><del class="diffmod">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</del></h4><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if

not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you

network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.</del></p><del class="diffmod">
