  The</ins> <del class="diffmod">PREAMBLE</del></strong><ins class="diffmod">licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
</ins></p>

<p><del class="diffmod">The</del><ins class="diffmod">
  This</ins> <del class="diffmod">purpose</del><ins class="diffmod">license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

  When we speak</ins> of <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">free</ins> <del class="diffmod">License</del><ins class="diffmod">software,</ins> <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed</ins> to make <del class="diffmod">a</del><ins class="diffmod">sure</ins> <del class="diffmod">manual,</del><ins class="diffmod">that</ins> <del class="diffmod">textbook, or other written</del><ins class="diffmod">you</ins>
<del class="diffmod">document "free" in</del><ins class="diffmod">have</ins> the <del class="diffdel">sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
</del>freedom to <del class="diffmod">copy</del><ins class="diffmod">distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs;</ins> and <del class="diffmod">redistribute</del><ins class="diffmod">that</ins> <del class="diffmod">it,</del><ins class="diffmod">you know you can do these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program</ins> with <del class="diffmod">or</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">without</del><ins class="diffmod">library,</ins> <del class="diffmod">modifying</del><ins class="diffmod">you</ins> <del class="diffmod">it,</del><ins class="diffmod">must</ins> <del class="diffmod">either</del><ins class="diffmod">provide</ins>
<del class="diffmod">commercially</del><ins class="diffmod">complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use</ins> or <del class="diffdel">noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while </del>not <del class="diffmod">being</del><ins class="diffmod">licensed at all.</ins>

  Most</ins> <del class="diffmod">responsible</del><ins class="diffmod">GNU</ins> <del class="diffmod">for</del><ins class="diffmod">software,</ins> <del class="diffmod">modifications</del><ins class="diffmod">including</ins> <del class="diffmod">made</del><ins class="diffmod">some libraries, is covered</ins> by <del class="diffdel">others.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
</del>the <del class="diffmod">document</del><ins class="diffmod">ordinary
GNU</ins> <del class="diffdel">must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU
</del>General Public License, which <del class="diffmod">is a copyleft license</del><ins class="diffmod">was</ins> designed for <del class="diffmod">free</del><ins class="diffmod">utility programs.  This</ins>
<del class="diffmod">software.</del><ins class="diffmod">license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.
</ins></p>

<p><del class="diffmod">We</del><ins class="diffmod">
  The reason we</ins> have <del class="diffmod">designed</del><ins class="diffmod">a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Because of</ins> this <ins class="diffins">blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public </ins>License <del class="diffmod">in</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> <del class="diffmod">order</del><ins class="diffmod">libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs</ins> to use <ins class="diffins">free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved </ins>it<ins class="diffins"> as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for

all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated

</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

     If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or

     its purpose remains meaningful.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library

 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

 If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.
