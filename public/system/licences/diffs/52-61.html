</del><p><del class="diffmod">This License</del><ins class="diffmod">that</ins> is a <del class="diffmod">kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of

software.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed
book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">This License applies to any manual or other</del><ins class="diffmod">covered</ins> work<del class="diffdel"> that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of
this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any
member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released</del> under this License.</p>

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy</del><ins class="diffmod">Code</ins> that is not<del class="diffdel">
"Transparent"</del> <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">Normally</ins> <del class="diffmod">called</del><ins class="diffmod">Copied</ins> <del class="diffmod">"Opaque".</del><ins class="diffmod">Code.</ins></p>

</ins><a name="section1"></a><ins class="diffmod">1. Grant</ins> of <del class="diffmod">suitable</del><ins class="diffmod">Additional</ins> <del class="diffmod">formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">2. VERBATIM COPYING</del></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">Permission.</ins></h4>

<p>You <del class="diffmod">may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">4. MODIFICATIONS</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:</del></p><del class="diffmod">
</del><ul><del class="diffmod">
</del><li><del class="diffmod">

compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their
being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
Document.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies</del><ins class="diffmod">requirements</ins> of

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include
a translation of this License provided that you also include the original
English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original English version of this License, the original
English version will prevail.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.</del></p><del class="diffdel">
