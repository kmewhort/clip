          the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
          not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
          be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
          create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
          must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
          Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
          requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from

          the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
          of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
          of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
          original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
          by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any
          reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
          a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will

          Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
          credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the

          avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
          by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
          manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
          this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
          or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
          by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
          Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
