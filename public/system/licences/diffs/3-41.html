A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
