51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</ins></pre><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">0. PREAMBLE</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
considered responsible for modifications made by others.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p>This <del class="diffmod">Agreement</del><ins class="diffmod">License</ins> is <del class="diffmod">between</del><ins class="diffmod">a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
the document must themselves be free in</ins> the <del class="diffmod">City</del><ins class="diffmod">same sense. It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
software.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
work, regardless</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Regina</del><ins class="diffmod">subject</ins> <del class="diffmod">(the &ldquo;City&rdquo;) and you (either an individual</del><ins class="diffmod">matter</ins> or <ins class="diffins">whether it is published as </ins>a <del class="diffmod">legal</del><ins class="diffmod">printed
book.</ins> <del class="diffmod">entity</del><ins class="diffmod">We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">This License applies to any manual or other work</ins> that <del class="diffmod">you</del><ins class="diffmod">contains</ins> <del class="diffmod">represent</del><ins class="diffmod">a</ins> <del class="diffmod">as an authorized employee or agent).</del><br><br><strong><del class="diffmod">Acceptance of Terms</del></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">notice</ins>
<p><del class="diffmod">Please review this Agreement carefully.  If you access, use or download any of the datasets (collectively, the &ldquo;Data&rdquo;) provided</del><ins class="diffmod">placed</ins> by the <del class="diffmod">City</del><ins class="diffmod">copyright</ins> <del class="diffmod">on</del><ins class="diffmod">holder</ins> <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">saying</ins> <del class="diffmod">website</del><ins class="diffmod">it</ins> <del class="diffmod">you acknowledge that you have read, understood, agree and have the capacity to</del><ins class="diffmod">can</ins> be <del class="diffmod">legally</del><ins class="diffmod">distributed</ins> <del class="diffmod">bound by</del><ins class="diffmod">under</ins> the terms of<ins class="diffins">
this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any
member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under</ins> this <del class="diffmod">Agreement.  If</del><ins class="diffmod">License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The</ins> <del class="diffmod">you</del><ins class="diffmod">"Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which</ins> do not <del class="diffmod">agree</del><ins class="diffmod">have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">2. VERBATIM COPYING</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies</ins> to the <del class="diffmod">terms</del><ins class="diffmod">Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those</ins> of this<ins class="diffins">
License.</ins> <del class="diffmod">Agreement,</del><ins class="diffmod">You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies</ins> you must <del class="diffmod">immediately</del><ins class="diffmod">also</ins> <del class="diffmod">discontinue</del><ins class="diffmod">follow the conditions in section 3.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing</ins> any <del class="diffmod">use</del><ins class="diffmod">large number</ins> of <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">copies,</ins> <del class="diffmod">website</del><ins class="diffmod">to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">4. MODIFICATIONS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may copy</ins> and <ins class="diffins">distribute a Modified Version of </ins>the <del class="diffmod">Data.</del><ins class="diffmod">Document</ins> </p><ins class="diffmod">under the</ins>
<p><strong><del class="diffmod">License</del><ins class="diffmod">conditions of sections 2</ins> and <del class="diffmod">Exceptions</del></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">3 above, provided that you release the Modified</ins>
<p><del class="diffmod">The</del><ins class="diffmod">Version</ins> <del class="diffmod">City</del><ins class="diffmod">under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Regina</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">grants</del><ins class="diffmod">Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the

multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else
a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the

combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License
in the various documents with a single copy that</ins> is <ins class="diffins">included in the collection,
</ins>provided <del class="diffmod">&ldquo;as</del><ins class="diffmod">that</ins> <del class="diffmod">is&rdquo;</del><ins class="diffmod">you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each

regarding verbatim copying of that document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a
compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their
being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
around the whole aggregate.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">8. TRANSLATION</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include
a translation of this License provided that you also include the original
English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the
translation</ins> and the <del class="diffmod">City</del><ins class="diffmod">original</ins> <del class="diffmod">excludes</del><ins class="diffmod">English</ins> <del class="diffmod">all</del><ins class="diffmod">version</ins> <del class="diffmod">representations,</del><ins class="diffmod">of</ins> <del class="diffmod">warranties,</del><ins class="diffmod">this</ins> <del class="diffmod">obligations</del><ins class="diffmod">License, the original

expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void,</ins> and <del class="diffmod">liabilities</del><ins class="diffmod">will automatically terminate
