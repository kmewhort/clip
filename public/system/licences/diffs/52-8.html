Document </del><ins class="diffmod">decide

authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the

which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">2. VERBATIM COPYING</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If</del><ins class="diffmod">whenever</ins> you use the <del class="diffmod">latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies</del><ins class="diffmod">Open
    Data</ins> in <del class="diffmod">quantity,</del><ins class="diffmod">electronic</ins> <del class="diffmod">to
ensure</del><ins class="diffmod">services</ins> <del class="diffmod">that</del><ins class="diffmod">such</ins> <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">as</ins> <del class="diffmod">Transparent</del><ins class="diffmod">websites,</ins> <del class="diffmod">copy</del><ins class="diffmod">web</ins> <del class="diffmod">will</del><ins class="diffmod">applications,</ins> <del class="diffmod">remain</del><ins class="diffmod">desktop</ins> <del class="diffmod">thus</del><ins class="diffmod">applications,
    mobile</ins> <del class="diffmod">accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffmod">4. MODIFICATIONS</del></strong></p><del class="diffmod">

License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else
a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the

combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled

</del><p><strong><del class="diffdel">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</del></strong></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each
of the documents in all other respects.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
regarding verbatim copying of that document.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffdel">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</del></strong></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a
compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their
being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
Document.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
around the whole aggregate.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffdel">8. TRANSLATION</del></strong></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include
a translation of this License provided that you also include the original
English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original English version of this License, the original
English version will prevail.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffdel">9. TERMINATION</del></strong></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><strong><del class="diffdel">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</del></strong></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

documents</del></a></h3><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
just after the title page:</del></p><del class="diffdel">
