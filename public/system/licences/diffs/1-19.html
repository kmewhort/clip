</del><a name="preamble"></a><del class="diffmod">Preamble</del></h3><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The GNU Affero General Public License is</del><ins class="diffmod">or</ins> a <del class="diffmod">free,</del><ins class="diffmod">legal</ins> <del class="diffmod">copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By
contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
remains free software for all its users.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish),</del><ins class="diffmod">entity</ins> that you <del class="diffmod">receive</del><ins class="diffmod">represent</ins> <del class="diffmod">source</del><ins class="diffmod">as</ins> <del class="diffmod">code</del><ins class="diffmod">an authorized employee</ins> or <del class="diffmod">can</del><ins class="diffmod">agent).</ins><br><br><strong><ins class="diffmod">Acceptance</ins> <del class="diffmod">get</del><ins class="diffmod">of</ins> <del class="diffmod">it</del><ins class="diffmod">Terms</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Please</ins> <del class="diffmod">if</del><ins class="diffmod">review this Agreement carefully.  If</ins> you<del class="diffdel">
want</del> <del class="diffmod">it,</del><ins class="diffmod">access, use or download any of the datasets (collectively, the &ldquo;Data&rdquo;) provided by the City on this website you acknowledge</ins> that you <del class="diffmod">can</del><ins class="diffmod">have</ins> <del class="diffmod">change</del><ins class="diffmod">read, understood, agree and have</ins> the <del class="diffmod">software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission</del><ins class="diffmod">capacity</ins> to <del class="diffmod">copy,</del><ins class="diffmod">be</ins> <del class="diffmod">distribute
and/or</del><ins class="diffmod">legally</ins> <del class="diffmod">modify the software.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged</del><ins class="diffmod">bound</ins> by <del class="diffdel">the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><h3><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="terms"></a><del class="diffdel">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</del></h3><del class="diffdel">

</del><h4><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="section0"></a><del class="diffdel">0. Definitions.</del></h4><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><h4><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="section1"></a><del class="diffdel">1. Source Code.</del></h4><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><h4><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="section2"></a><del class="diffdel">2. Basic Permissions.</del></h4><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
</del>the terms of this <del class="diffmod">License in conveying all material for which</del><ins class="diffmod">Agreement.  If</ins> you do<del class="diffmod">

</del><h4><del class="diffmod">
</del><a name="section4"></a><del class="diffmod">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</del></h4><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may convey verbatim copies</del><ins class="diffmod">reproduction</ins> of the <del class="diffmod">Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that</del><ins class="diffmod">Data,</ins> you <del class="diffmod">conspicuously</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> <del class="diffmod">and

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,

</del><a name="section5"></a><del class="diffdel">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</del></h4><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><ul><del class="diffdel">
</del><li><del class="diffdel">a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.</del></li><del class="diffdel">

</del><li><del class="diffdel">b) The work must carry prominent notices stating</del> that it is<del class="diffdel">
    released</del> <del class="diffmod">under</del><ins class="diffmod">publically</ins> <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">available</ins> <del class="diffmod">License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies</del><ins class="diffmod">from</ins> the <del class="diffmod">requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del></ul><del class="diffmod">
</del><p><del class="diffmod">A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

machine-readable Corresponding Source</del><ins class="diffmod">City</ins> under the terms of this <del class="diffmod">License,

</del><li><del class="diffmod">c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the

    alternative</del><ins class="diffmod">credit</ins> is <del class="diffmod">allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

</del><li><del class="diffmod">d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated

    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by</del><ins class="diffmod">endorses</ins> you or <del class="diffmod">a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the

    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</del></li><del class="diffmod">

doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><a name="section10"></a><del class="diffmod">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</del></h4><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><a name="section11"></a><del class="diffmod">11. Patents.</del></h4><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled</del><ins class="diffmod">overlooking</ins> by the <del class="diffmod">contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License,</del><ins class="diffmod">City</ins> of <del class="diffdel">making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is </del>any <del class="diffmod">express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed</del><ins class="diffmod">default</ins> by you <del class="diffmod">(or</del><ins class="diffmod">in</ins> <del class="diffmod">copies made from those copies),</del><ins class="diffmod">performing</ins> or <del class="diffmod">(b)</del><ins class="diffmod">observing</ins> <del class="diffdel">primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
