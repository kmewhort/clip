</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed
book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of
this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any
member</ins> of the <del class="diffmod">Work</del><ins class="diffmod">public</ins> <del class="diffmod">in
          timed-relation</del><ins class="diffmod">is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or</ins> with <ins class="diffins">modifications and/or
translated into another language.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A "Secondary Section" is </ins>a <del class="diffmod">moving</del><ins class="diffmod">named</ins> <del class="diffmod">image</del><ins class="diffmod">appendix</ins> <del class="diffmod">("synching")</del><ins class="diffmod">or</ins> <del class="diffmod">will</del><ins class="diffmod">a</ins> <del class="diffmod">be

Document that deals exclusively with</ins> the <del class="diffmod">purpose</del><ins class="diffmod">relationship</ins> of <ins class="diffins">the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that

represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,

or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you</ins> as <del class="diffmod">appropriate,</del><ins class="diffmod">the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or</ins> through <del class="diffmod">sale</del><ins class="diffmod">your agents</ins> or <del class="diffmod">other
