  it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
  whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License

  refers to any such manual or work.  Any member</ins> of the <del class="diffmod">City,</del><ins class="diffmod">public is a
  licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
  copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
  under copyright law.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
  Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
  modifications and/or translated into another language.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
  the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
  publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
  (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
  within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
  textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
  mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
  connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
  commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
  them.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
  are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
  that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
  section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
  allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
  Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
  Sections then there are none.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
  as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
  the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
  be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the
  general public, that is suitable for revising the document
  straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
  pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
  drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
  for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
  to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
  format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
  or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
  An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
  of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
  ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
  or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
  HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
  transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
  include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
  proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
  processing tools are not generally available, and the
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
  processors for output purposes only.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
  plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
  this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
  formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
  the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
  preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
  title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
  text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
  specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
  "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
  of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
  section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
  states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
  Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
  License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
  implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
  no effect on the meaning of this License.

  </ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">2. VERBATIM COPYING</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod">
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
  commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
  copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
  to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
  conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
  technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
  copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,</ins> you may <ins class="diffins">accept
  compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
  number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
  you may publicly display copies.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  </ins><strong><ins class="diffins">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</ins></strong><ins class="diffins">
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
  printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
  Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
  copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
  Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
  the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
  you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
  the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
  visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
  the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can </ins>be<ins class="diffins"> treated
  as verbatim copying in other respects.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  If the</ins> required <ins class="diffins">texts for either cover are too voluminous </ins>to <del class="diffmod">remove</del><ins class="diffmod">fit
  legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
  reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
  pages.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
  more than 100, you must either include</ins> a <del class="diffmod">credit</del><ins class="diffmod">machine-readable Transparent
  copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
  a computer-network location</ins> from <del class="diffmod">future</del><ins class="diffmod">which</ins> <del class="diffmod">uses</del><ins class="diffmod">the general network-using
  public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
  a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
  when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
  that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
  location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
  Opaque copy (directly</ins> or <del class="diffmod">reproductions</del><ins class="diffmod">through</ins> <del class="diffmod">should</del><ins class="diffmod">your agents or retailers) of that
  edition to</ins> the <del class="diffmod">City,</del><ins class="diffmod">public.
