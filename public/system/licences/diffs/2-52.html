and/or</del><ins class="diffmod">manual</ins> <del class="diffmod">modify the software.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

However,</del><ins class="diffmod">holder</ins> <del class="diffmod">in</del><ins class="diffmod">saying it can be distributed under</ins> the <del class="diffmod">case</del><ins class="diffmod">terms</ins> of
<del class="diffdel">software used on network servers, </del>this <del class="diffmod">result</del><ins class="diffmod">License.</ins> <del class="diffdel">may fail to come about.
</del>The <del class="diffmod">GNU</del><ins class="diffmod">"Document",</ins> <del class="diffmod">General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">"The Program"</del><ins class="diffmod">below,</ins> refers to any <del class="diffmod">copyrightable</del><ins class="diffmod">such</ins> <del class="diffmod">work</del><ins class="diffmod">manual</ins> <del class="diffmod">licensed</del><ins class="diffmod">or</ins> <del class="diffmod">under</del><ins class="diffmod">work.</ins> <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">Any</ins>

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">2. VERBATIM COPYING</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,</ins> and
<del class="diffmod">"recipients"</del><ins class="diffmod">the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">4. MODIFICATIONS</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><ul><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">A.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod"> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a

    of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
    original publisher of that version gives permission.</ins></li><ins class="diffmod">

  </ins><li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><strong><ins class="diffmod">B.</ins></strong><ins class="diffmod"> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more

    is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the
    title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title

(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><h4><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="section11"></a><del class="diffdel">11. Patents.</del></h4><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><h4><del class="diffdel">
</del><a name="section12"></a><del class="diffdel">12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</del></h4><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission

free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
