  </del><ins class="diffmod">work for any purpose and without any restrictions. This licence is intended for use on databases or their contents (&ldquo;data&rdquo;), either together or individually.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Many databases are covered by copyright. Some jurisdictions, mainly in Europe, have specific special rights that cover databases called the &ldquo;sui generis&rdquo; database right. Both of these sets of rights, as well as other legal rights used to protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or practical difficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying data but retain a limited amount of rights under a &ldquo;some rights reserved&rdquo; approach to licensing as outlined in the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data. As a result, this waiver and licence tries to the fullest extent possible to eliminate or fully license any rights that cover this database and data. Any Community Norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form a part </ins>of this <del class="diffdel">license </del>document, <del class="diffmod">but</del><ins class="diffmod">and</ins> <del class="diffmod">changing</del><ins class="diffmod">do</ins> <del class="diffmod">it</del><ins class="diffmod">not act as a contract for access or other terms of use for the database or data.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">The position of the recipient of the work</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Because this document places the database and its contents in or as close as possible within the public domain, there are no restrictions or requirements placed on the recipient by this document. Recipients may use this work commercially, use technical protection measures, combine this data or database with other databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep them secret. It</ins> is not <del class="diffmod">allowed.

  </del><strong><ins class="diffmod">The position of the dedicator of the work</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">Copyright law, as with most other law under the banner of &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;, is inherently national law. This means that there exists several differences in how copyright and other IP rights can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world. This is despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection. The internet and other communication technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights, for use by the global community. Because of this feature of intellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to license these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p>The purpose of this <del class="diffmod">License</del><ins class="diffmod">document</ins> is to <del class="diffmod">make</del><ins class="diffmod">enable</ins> <del class="diffmod">a</del><ins class="diffmod">rightsholders</ins> <del class="diffmod">manual,</del><ins class="diffmod">to</ins> <del class="diffmod">textbook,</del><ins class="diffmod">place their work into the public domain. Unlike licences for free and open source software, free cultural works,</ins> or <del class="diffmod">other
  functional</del><ins class="diffmod">open content licences, rightsholders will not be able to &ldquo;dual license&rdquo; their work by releasing the same work under different licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they choose. Rightsholders therefore can&rsquo;t re-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license. Doing so creates truly accessible data to build rich applications</ins> and <del class="diffmod">useful</del><ins class="diffmod">advance the progress of science and the arts.</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">This</ins> document <del class="diffmod">"free"</del><ins class="diffmod">can</ins> <del class="diffmod">in</del><ins class="diffmod">cover</ins> <del class="diffmod">the sense of freedom: to

  Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
  to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
  for modifications made by others.

  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the

  to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
  conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
  technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further

  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
  printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
  Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
  copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
  Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
  the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
  you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
  the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
  visible.  You may add</del> other material <del class="diffmod">on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
  the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
  as verbatim copying in other respects.
</del></p><del class="diffmod">

</del><p><del class="diffmod">
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
  legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
  reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
  pages.

  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
  more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
  copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
  a computer-network location from which the general network-using
  public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
  a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
  when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
  that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
  location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
  Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
  edition to the public.
