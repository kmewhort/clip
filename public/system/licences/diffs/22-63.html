  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  </ins>If you <del class="diffmod">use</del><ins class="diffmod">link</ins> <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">a</ins> <del class="diffmod">website,</del><ins class="diffmod">program with the library,</ins> you <del class="diffmod">agree</del><ins class="diffmod">must provide
complete object files</ins> to the <del class="diffmod">following</del><ins class="diffmod">recipients</ins> <del class="diffmod">Terms</del><ins class="diffmod">so</ins> <del class="diffmod">of</del><ins class="diffmod">that</ins> <del class="diffmod">Use</del><ins class="diffmod">they</ins> <del class="diffmod">If</del><ins class="diffmod">can</ins> <del class="diffmod">you</del><ins class="diffmod">relink</ins> <del class="diffmod">do not agree

it.  And</ins> you must <del class="diffmod">leave</del><ins class="diffmod">show them these terms so they know their rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you</ins> this <del class="diffmod">website</del><ins class="diffmod">license</ins> <del class="diffmod">immediately.</del><ins class="diffmod">which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

</ins></p><del class="diffmod">

    </del><h2><del class="diffmod">You</del><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Also,</ins> <del class="diffmod">may</del><ins class="diffmod">for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free</ins> use <ins class="diffins">or not licensed at all.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  Because of </ins>this <del class="diffmod">website</del><ins class="diffmod">blurred</ins> <del class="diffmod">if</del><ins class="diffmod">distinction,</ins> <del class="diffmod">you</del><ins class="diffmod">using</ins> <del class="diffmod">agree</del><ins class="diffmod">the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention</ins> to the <del class="diffmod">following</del><ins class="diffmod">difference</ins> <del class="diffmod">terms</del></h2><del class="diffmod">

 This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for

     If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the

it.

  However,</ins> <del class="diffmod">any</del><ins class="diffmod">linking</ins> <del class="diffmod">time,</del><ins class="diffmod">a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it

Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file

</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the</ins> use of <ins class="diffins">the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing </ins>this <del class="diffmod">Site</del><ins class="diffmod">object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
