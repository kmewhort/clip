Everyone</ins> is <del class="diffmod">between</del><ins class="diffmod">permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast,</ins> the <del class="diffmod">City</del><ins class="diffmod">GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Regina</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">(the</del><ins class="diffmod">Free</ins> <del class="diffmod">&ldquo;City&rdquo;)</del><ins class="diffmod">Software
Foundation's software</ins> and <ins class="diffins">to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if </ins>you <del class="diffmod">(either an individual or a legal entity</del><ins class="diffmod">wish),</ins> that you <del class="diffmod">represent</del><ins class="diffmod">receive</ins> <del class="diffmod">as</del><ins class="diffmod">source</ins> <del class="diffmod">an authorized employee</del><ins class="diffmod">code</ins> or <del class="diffmod">agent).</del><br><br><strong><del class="diffmod">Acceptance</del><ins class="diffmod">can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces</ins> of <del class="diffmod">Terms</del></strong><ins class="diffmod">it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</ins>
<ins class="diffins">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><del class="diffmod">Please</del><ins class="diffmod">
  For</ins> <del class="diffmod">review</del><ins class="diffmod">example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you</ins> this <del class="diffmod">Agreement</del><ins class="diffmod">license</ins> <del class="diffmod">carefully.</del><ins class="diffmod">which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.</ins>  If <del class="diffmod">you</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">access,</del><ins class="diffmod">software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free</ins> use or <del class="diffmod">download</del><ins class="diffmod">not licensed at all.
</ins></p><ins class="diffmod">

modification follow.

language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights</ins> or <del class="diffmod">deletions</del><ins class="diffmod">contest

</ins><p><ins class="diffmod">
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program

otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further

 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or

distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License</ins> and <del class="diffmod">Indemnity</del></strong><ins class="diffmod">any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
