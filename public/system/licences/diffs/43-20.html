          that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
          This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as

          of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
          of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
          original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
          by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable

          Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will

          Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
